It started as a humorous protest against the spread of 7 fast food around the world and has developed into a major advocate for the world's&nbsp;unique food products. The movement's logo is a snail. Since being founded in 1986 the</p><p>Slow Food snail has crept from its home in Italy to 45 other countries around the world and now boasts over 650,000 members. The movement challenges the loss of flavour resulting from the&nbsp;industrialisation of food and agriculture. Its approach is 'eco-gastronomic'. Slow Food is committed to&nbsp;compiling and distributing information about local foods, drink and culture. Its purpose is to&nbsp;preserve endangered foods, encourage bio-diversity, and support small-scale producers of ethnic and&nbsp;local products around the world.</p><p><strong>B</strong></p><p><span class="explainq37 explain">Modern&nbsp;agri-business has given the world cheap food with little taste, produced at a high cost to the environment</span>.<span class="explainqslow explain"> Slow </span>Food has been instrumental in developing initiatives to revive&nbsp;products that take time and craftsmanship to create and which are threatened by global&nbsp;corporate practices. Protecting traditional local products also means safeguarding the people&nbsp;and ecosystems involved in their manufacture. It also provides incentives for the pursuit of production methods which are healthier for taste, the environment and the agricultural economy.</p><p><strong>C</strong></p><p><span class="explainq29 explain">Statistics on the loss of biodiversity in our food chain are alarming. In less than a century over 300,000 plant species have disappeared — one plant species disappears every six hours</span>. Today less than 30 varieties of plant feed 95% of the world's population. In Europe, half the&nbsp;breeds of domestic livestock became extinct during the course of the twentieth century. The&nbsp;crisis over <span class="explainq39 explain">mad cow disease</span> and the ongoing debate over genetically modified food have given Slow Food,with its emphasis on organic methods, unexpected political influence.</p><p><strong>D</strong></p><p>In the space of a few years, Slow Food has become a major lobbying force in the European Union on agriculture and trade policy.&nbsp;Agri-business practices that have become dominant&nbsp;worldwide are geared to production in quantity. This is a carryover from agricultural policies&nbsp;set in the 1950s in Europe, when hunger from the war was still a vivid memory. At that time,&nbsp;when the goal was self sufficiency, farmers received subsidies according to the amounts they produced.&nbsp;There was and still is no reward for quality. Two generations ago,<span class="explainq31 explain"> the average European family spent about&nbsp;one half of its income on food. Today it spends about 15 per cent. Surveys conducted by Slow Food show&nbsp;that a large majority of Italians would be willing to pay up to 20 per cent more for food in order to guarantee its quality, especially given recent food scares and scandals.</span></p><p><strong>E&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As national boundaries disappear in Europe and become more open around the world, food has emerged as an important source of identity. Slow Food's position on&nbsp;globalisation&nbsp;is that it has the potential to help as well as harm the small food producer. On the one hand,&nbsp;globalisation&nbsp;has allowed multinational corporations to&nbsp;extend their reach to virtually every comer of the world. However,<span class="explainq35 explain"> rather than being afraid of the<span class="explainq40 explain">&nbsp;fast food </span>giants, Slow Food is attempting to offer an alternative choice of "virtuous&nbsp;globalisation"&nbsp;by choosing to focus on quality and helping the small, local producer to access the global market</span>.</p><p><strong>F</strong></p><p>The Slow Food organisation had to find ways to ensure its own economic viability.</p><p>An initial strategy to generate income through publishing led to a number of food guides that were quickly successful Some of the most popular of these feature&nbsp;restaurants serving authentic, local foods at local prices.<span class="explainq38 explain"> <span class="explainq30">Numerous and varied&nbsp;initiatives have sprung up since</span>. The popular quarterly magazine, 'SLOW', features articles about&nbsp;food culture around the world</span>. <span class="explainq36 explain">Italy's largest food show, the 'Salon de Gusto'</span>, sponsored by the Slow&nbsp;Food movement, provides an international market to hundreds of small producers whose goods,&nbsp;until recently, rarely left their village or region.<span class="explainq33 explain"> Now there is even 'slow travel'. A growing number&nbsp;of tour operators in Italy, France, Australia and India</span> subscribe to the movement, promoting&nbsp;"cultural and educational journeys using food and the people that produce it as the learning&nbsp;medium." 'Slow cities' are entire communities dedicated to improving the quality of life for their&nbsp;citizens through environmentally sound, culturally-aware,&nbsp;eco-gastronomic policies and activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>G</strong></p><p><span class="explainq28 explain">Another significant initiative of <span class="explainqslow explain">Slow</span> Food is the Ark of Taste, a database of endangered species of edible plants and domestic animals worldwide. Commissions have been set up in many countries to seek out and catalogue new products</span>. So far, 800 products from 26 countries have been figuratively brought&nbsp;onboard&nbsp;the Ark in an&nbsp;attempt to save them. <span class="explainq34 explain">The Ark of Taste has become an international project and a resource for agricultural biodiversity around the world.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;H</strong></p><p>So, a movement that began as a humorous protest against fast food has, in its own organic way, evolved into a versatile and intelligent advocate for the protection of&nbsp;the environment. The best response to global forces challenging the ability to enjoy&nbsp;our food and our lives begins, according to the Slow Food movement, 'at the table'. We&nbsp;are invited to slow down, appreciate the flavours of food and drink, and cultivate the art of living.&nbsp;Fast food isn't likely to disappear, but Slow Food seems to be here to stay as well. Its message is&nbsp;getting through — encouraging a pleasure-loving environmentalism as an alternative to the highspeed pace of the fast-food world. From its humble beginnings, Slow Food now includes a global&nbsp;network of people capable of generating ideas, and programs to defend the right to a responsible form of pleasure, respectful of cultural diversity and available to all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
