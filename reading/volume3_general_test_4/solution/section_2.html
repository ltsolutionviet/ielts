These are the basic items of personal equipment that need to be fitted to you by a dive store professional.</p><p>For reasons of <span class="explainq15 explain">safety</span> and <span class="explainq15 explain">comfort</span>, we recommend that you buy dive equipment only at a dive store.</p><p><strong>STEP 6:</strong>&nbsp;Be enthusiastic. An important part of your training involves going back to the classroom and learning about the<span class="explainq16 explain"> dive environment</span>, <span class="explainq16 explain">physics</span> and <span class="explainq16 explain">safety practices</span>.</p><p><strong>STEP 7:</strong>&nbsp;Get wet! Your first dives will take place in a swimming pool. Be prepared for your first breath on a regulator (breathing apparatus) under water!</p><p><strong>STEP 8:</strong>&nbsp;Go diving Your open-water training <span class="explainq16 explain">dives</span> provide the opportunity to practise the skills you learned in your classroom and pool work!</p><p><strong>STEP 9:</strong>&nbsp;Use your <span class="explainq17 explain">'C-card'</span> now that you’re a certified diver! Only card-carrying divers can buy scuba life-support equipment. We also encourage you to begin right now selecting your personal equipment, especially a regulator, buoyancy compensator and dive computer. Having <span class="explainq18 explain">your own equipment</span> will make you safer and more&nbsp;comfortable under water.</p><p><strong>STEP 10:</strong>&nbsp;Go for more. Your certification is really just the beginning. You still need to serve <span class="explainq19 explain">a diving internship</span> with your instructor and other experienced divers. Sign up for more training or dives under&nbsp;supervision as soon as you can</p><h2 class="text-align-center">&nbsp;FEAR NO MORE</h2><p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s natural to be scared at first, but statistics show scuba diving is not particularly dangerous. It is estimated that there are 2.4 million divers and 17 million dives&nbsp;made in the U.S. per year. Divers Alert Network, the leading safety organisation&nbsp;lor divers. reported only 85 fatalities in the past year. Most of us find that as our ability</p><p>increases, our fears decrease. The risks in scuba diving, while real, can all be reduced significantly by what you do for your own safely. Here are some of the most common fears&nbsp;of new scuba divers.</p><p><strong>B</strong></p><p>It’s understandable if you mistrust your scuba regulator. But mechanical failure of your breathing equipment is highly unlikely. A regulator is simple, strong and&nbsp;designed so that if it does fail, it delivers more air than you need, not less. You</p><p>will also have an extra breathing system, and so will your diving buddy. Keep an eye on your air gauges and time. <span class="explainq20 explain">If you are running out of air you will find that you have to suck&nbsp;harder to breathe. You will still have time to ascend slowly, even if you have to hold your&nbsp;breath.</span> If you stay above <span class="explainq24 explain">60 feet</span> and stay out of caves and wrecks — good advice for all&nbsp;new divers — there is no reason to be afraid of running out of air under water.</p><p><strong>C</strong></p><p><span class="explainq21 explain">“The bends’* is the decompression sickness most people associate with diving, but in fact it is almost preventable. Divers most often get the bends by going too&nbsp;deep and coming up<span class="explainq25 explain"> too quickly</span>. It is not a serious risk if you stay above 60&nbsp;feet. A safety stop of three minutes at 15 feet is a wise precaution</span>. Cases of the bends do occur rarely, but the sickness is normally treatable.</p><p><strong>D</strong></p><p>Most fish ignore you or swim away. <span class="explainq22 explain">They have very narrow diets and eat only what they are accustomed to,however, sometimes sharks have been known to&nbsp;make attacks on human</span>s. Even here, there is evidence that the shark mistakes a human for his regular meal, a seal or sea-lion, and shark attacks are very rare. In the presence of sharks, <span class="explainq26 explain">remain calm</span>. Don't annoy sharks by poking at them. Almost all fish&nbsp;will leave you alone if you do the same to them.</p><p><strong>E</strong></p><p><span class="explainq23 explain">Fear can sometimes overwhelm the intellect and leaves some people paralysed. The best prevention is training. You will be taught the correct response to&nbsp;danger.</span> When you<span class="explainq27 explain"> practise</span> the response, it will be there when you need it.&nbsp;When you know just what to do, you're much less likely to lose self-control. And experience — simply diving again and again — reduces the general anxiety level that is natural when diving is still new. When you realise you are not helpless, your fears are&nbsp;likely to disappear</p></div></div>
