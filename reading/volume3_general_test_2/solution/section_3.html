    <h2 class="subtitle"> Great Inventions</h2>
    <div class="passage-content"><p>There are some things we use every day. Can you imagine a world
        without zippers to fasten clothing? Have you ever wondered about the layout of the keyboard
        of a typewriter, which we see every day on the computer? These are just two of the many
        inventions which have made our lives easier. Maybe that’s why we don’t think about them very
        much!</p>
        <p><strong>The Zipper</strong></p>
        <p>Whatever did we do before the invention of the zipper?</p>
        <p><span class="explainq32 explain">In 1893 the world’s first zipper was produced in Chicago. Although the inventor claimed that it was a reliable fastening for clothing, this was not the case. The Chicago zipper sprang open without warning, or jammed shut, and it swiftly lost popularity. Twenty years later a Swedish-born engineer called Sundback </span>solved
            the problem. He attached tiny cups to the backs of the interlocking teeth, and this
            meant that the teeth could be enmeshed more firmly and reliably.</p>
        <p>At first zippers were made of metal. They were heavy, and if they got stuck it was
            difficult to free them. Then came nylon zippers which were lighter and easier to use,
            and had smaller teeth. The fashion industry liked the new zippers far better because
            they did not distort the line of the garment or weigh down light fabrics. They were also
            easier for the machinists to fit into the garment.</p>
        <p><span class="explainq34 explain">Meanwhile a new fastening agent made its appearance at the end of the twentieth century: velcro. Velcro is another product made from nylon</span>.<span
                class="explainq33 explain"> Nylon is a very tough synthetic fibre first developed in the 1930s, </span>and
            bearing a name to remind the hearer of the two places where it was developed: NY for New
            York and LON for London. Velcro is made with very small nylon hooks on one side of the
            fastening which catch tiny looped whiskers on the other side of the fastening. It is
            strong and durable.</p>
        <p>Velcro is used on clothing, luggage and footwear. It is quick and easy to fasten and
            unfasten, and has taken a large part of the zipper’s share of the market.<span
                    class="explainq38 explain"> It is also used in ways a zipper cannot be used – for instance as an easily changed fastening on plaster casts, and to hold furnishing fabrics in position.</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Typewriter and the Keyboard</strong></p>
        <p><span class="explainq40 explain">The keyboard of the modern typewriter is laid out in a most odd fashion. Why would anyone place the letters on the left side of the top row of the keyboard in the order QWERTY? </span>The
            answer is simple: to slow the typist down. But first, let’s consider the history of the
            typewriter itself.</p>
        <p><span class="explainq36 explain">In the 1860’s a newspaper editor called Christopher Sholes lived in Milwaukee, USA. Sholes invented the first of the modern typewriters</span>,
            although there had been patents for<span class="explainq35 explain"> typewriter-like machines as early as 1714</span>,
            when Queen Anne of England granted a patent to a man called Henry Mill for a machine
            which would make marks on paper “so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from
            print“. In 1829, across the Atlantic in Detroit USA, William Austin Burt took out a
            patent on a typewriter-like machine, four years before the French inventor Xavier
            Projean produced his machine designed to record words at a speed comparable to someone
            writing with a pen.</p>
        <p>So the typewriter was not a new idea, although there had not been a successful
            realisation of the idea before Christopher Sholes’ machine. His typewriter became very
            popular, and soon people learned to type very quickly – so quickly, in fact, that the
            keys became tangled. On manual typewriters the characters were set on the end of bars
            which rose to strike the paper when the key was pressed. In the first models, the keys
            were set alphabetically. When a quick typist tapped out a word like federal, it was very
            likely the adjacent e and d keys would become entangled.</p>
        <p>Sholes therefore set about finding ways to slow the typist down. He looked for the
            letters which were most often used in English, and then placed them far away from each
            other. For instance, q and u, which are almost always used together in English, are
            separated by five intervening letters. The plan worked, and the typist was slowed down a
            little.</p>
        <p>When computers came into use in the latter part of the twentieth century it was suggested
            that the keyboard should be rationalised. After all, there was no longer any need to
            avoid clashing manual typewriter keys. One new board included keys which produced
            letters which frequently occur together in English, like<em> ing </em>and <em>th</em>
            and <em>ed</em>, so the word thing would take two strokes to write instead of five.
            Although this made perfect sense, people found it very hard to learn to use a new
            keyboard, and the idea was dropped. It is unlikely that the keyboard will ever be
            changed: as we approach<span class="explainq37 explain"> the twenty-first century the voice-activated computer, already in an advanced state of development, is becoming more and more accessible. It is very likely that we will soon have machines which take dictation as we speak to them, and the keyboard will be used for corrections.</span>
