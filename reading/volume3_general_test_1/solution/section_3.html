    <h2 class="subtitle"> Business Planning</h2>
    <div class="passage-content"><p><strong>What is a Business plan?</strong></p>
        <p><span class="explainq28 explain">It is probably best described as a summary and evaluation of your business idea, in writing.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Preparation of a business plan is the first and most important task for the business
            starter. <span class="explainq30 explain">The plan should include details concerning the industry in which you operate, your product or service, marketing, production, personnel and financial strategies.</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>What purpose does it serve?</strong></p>
        <p>A business plan allows you to think through all the factors of a business, and to solve
            potential problems before you come to them. It will identify strengths and weaknesses
            and help to assess whether the business can succeed.<span class="explainq29 explain"> It is a blueprint for starting, maintaining or expanding a business.</span>
            It is a working plan to use in comparing your achievements to the goals you set. It
            should provide information required by financial institutions when finance is sought.
        </p>
        <p><strong> </strong></p>
        <p><strong>How to produce a Business plan</strong></p>
        <p><em>Step 1: Collect Information</em></p>
        <p>Gather as much relevant information as possible concerning the industry in which you
            intend to operate (the number of businesses already operating, the size of their
            operations, where they are located). <span class="explainq35 explain">Use books, industry associations, and existing business owners to help you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Collect all possible information regarding the market/s you are aiming for (who buys, why
            do they buy, what are the key features the customer looks for).</p>
        <p>Learn all you can about the product/s or services you intend to produce, distribute or
            offer.</p>
        <p><em>Step 2: Analysis</em></p>
        <p>Read over all the material you have collected and decide what is relevant to your
            business idea. You may have to modify your idea depending on what your research shows.
            The key question to ask is:</p>
        <p><span class="explainq31 explain"> “<span class="explainq36 explain">Can you design a business that will earn enough to cover costs and pay a wage and reasonable profit to you as proprietor?”</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>When Steps 1 and 2 are completed, you should have decided if there is a market for your
            product or service which is large enough and sufficiently accessible to make your new
            business financially worthwhile. Now you are ready to commit your plan to paper.</p>
        <p><em>Step 3: Strategy Formulation</em></p>
        <p>Decide how the business will operate. <span class="explainq38 explain">You should describe how the business will be managed, and the staff and organisational structure that will be in place</span>.
            Diagrams may be useful to show how these areas will work. <span
                    class="explainq32 explain">Don’t forget to include the areas of responsibility for each member of staff. This is especially important if some of your staff will be family members.</span>
        </p>
        <p>There are three further parts that go together to <span class="explainq37 explain">make a comprehensive business plan:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="explainq39 explain">A Marketing plan, which includes location, method of selling, packaging, pricing and so on. In all these areas you must be aware of consumer trends to make sure that your business does not become outdated or irrelevant.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="explainq39 explain">An Operational plan, which describes the day-to-day running of the business. You should include supply sources, cost and quantities of materials, processes, equipment and methods of extending the services or products <span
                    class="explainq31">offered.</span></span></li>
            <li><span class="explainq39 explain">A Financial plan, which is a master budget for the operation and includes:</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="explainq39 explain">– cash flow forecast</span></p>
        <p><span class="explainq39 explain">– balance sheet</span></p>
        <p><span class="explainq39 explain">– profit and loss statement</span></p>
        <p><span class="explainq39 explain">– sources of finance</span></p>
        <p><span class="explainq39 explain">– sales forecast and target.</span></p>
        <p>The financial aspects of the plan are most important and you should develop or access
            financial skills to make sure this part of your plan is accurate and realistic. <span
                    class="explainq33 explain">Don’t forget set-up costs and the money needed to see you through an initial period of low cash flow when calculating your first year’s budget</span>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Update your Business plan</strong></p>
        <p>Nothing remains constant in business; circumstances change, markets change, fashions
            change, methods change.</p>
        <p><span class="explainq40 explain">From time to time you must check your sources of information and reassess your business plan. What is relevant when you start is not necessarily so in five years’ time. You may also need to revise targets and budgets if external factors (such as interest rates) vary.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="explainq40 explain"> <span class="explainq34">Keep your information up-to-date and be prepared to change as circumstances demand. A business plan should be thought of as flexible, not fixed. If you use these steps to develop a business plan, changing it according to circumstances, you will be well on the way to a successful business.</span></span>
