                <td><p><strong>Morpeth</strong> is today a small town about two hours’ drive north
                    of Sydney. The town of Morpeth grew from an original 2000 acres of land given to
                    an English army officer, Lieutenant Edward Close (1790-1866), in <span
                            class="explainq1 explain">1821</span>. During the 1830s and 1840s
                    Morpeth became a major river port, due to its favourable location. Produce,
                    hides and timber were brought to Morpeth from inland New South Wales and shipped
                    down <span class="explainq2 explain">the Hunter river </span>to the coast and
                    then to Sydney. However, in <span class="explainq3 explain">1870</span> a
                    railway line reached the town, and the importance of river shipping began to
                    decline. Today, Morpeth, with its beautiful old buildings, is a popular tourist
                    destination.</p></td>

        <p>The best way to see Morpeth is to take the Morpeth Heritage Walk. This covers about three
            kilometres, and takes visitors past many beautiful historical buildings. Starting at Fig
            Tree Hill, which has picnic facilities, stroll past the <span class="explainq8 explain">Surgeon’s Cottage</span>,
            built in 1845, formerly home of the local doctor, now shops. From there you will come to<span
                    class="explainq9 explain"> Morpeth Bridge</span>, erected in 1870, which
            replaced a ferry boat. Opposite it on the right is the <span class="explainq10 explain">Courthouse</span>,
            still in use today. Continue your walk past the historic <span
                    class="explainq11 explain">Railway Station</span>, then turn into George Street.
            Stroll past gracious houses until you come to the <span class="explainq12 explain">Church of the Immaculate Conception</span>
            on your right, built of bricks made in Gosford. Continuing up George Street, you come to
            the<span class="explainq13 explain"> shopping district</span>; browse through the shops
            or stop for refreshment. Your tour of Morpeth will finish at magnificent <span
                    class="explainq14 explain">Closebourne House</span>, built in 1826 by Lieutenant
            Edward Close.</p>
