    <h2 class="subtitle"> Numeracy Centre</h2>
    <div class="passage-content"><p>Many business and marketing courses require a knowledge of
        introductory statistics, computing or mathematics. If you feel inadequately prepared for
        your course, you can get help from the Numeracy Centre, which offers FREE elementary help in
        maths and statistics. Grab a timetable from the Centre and drop in when it suits you.</p>
        <p><strong>COURSE A</strong></p>
        <p>The first course available to students is a Revision Course in Basic Maths.<span
                class="explainq24 explain"> This 3-hour <span
                class="explainq16 explain">lecture </span>will review mathematical concepts necessary for elementary statistics, such as fractions, area and percentages up to a Year 8 level of mathematics. </span>It
            is not necessary to book, so feel free to drop in. <span class="explainq15 explain">This session is FREE!</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>COURSE B</strong></p>
        <p>For those students doing marketing courses, and other courses requiring statistical
            analysis, there is the Bridging Course in <span class="explainq20 explain">Statistics for Marketing</span><span
                    class="explainq17 explain"><span class="explainq27 explain">This three-day course introduces ideas in elementary statistics to provide a starting point for further developments in statistical skills later on in other courses.</span> The course is run in sessions of three hours,</span>
            in the form of a one-hour lecture followed by a two-hour <span
                    class="explainq18 explain">tutorial. </span>Examples will be drawn from the
            reference books listed. The tutorials will be interactive where possible (eg. drawing
            random samples from the population of numbered cards in class) with hands-on experience
            of data manipulation using MINITAB on a bank of PCs.</p>
        <p><strong>COURSE C</strong></p>
        <p><span class="explainq19 explain">Statistics for the Practitioner is slightly different to the previous course, which must be completed before this course. This course is largely non-mathematical. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="explainq26 explain">It will instead concentrate on the interpretation and application of statistics rather than on computation. </span>The
            statistical package MTNITAB will be used as a teaching tool. This course will be
            conducted over two days in the form of workshops and small group discussions, with a
            strong emphasis on hands-on experience of data manipulation using computers.</p>
        <p><strong>COURSE D</strong></p>
        <p><span class="explainq23 explain">A further course of interest to many students is English for Computer Studies</span>.
            Students with English as their second language who will be needing elementary computing
            for their courses are encouraged to enrol in this 8-hour course. <span
                    class="explainq23 explain">Students will learn through <span
                    class="explainq22 explain">workshops </span>giving hands-on experience. The cost of the course is<span
                    class="explainq21"> $15</span> which includes notes and refreshments.</span></p>
