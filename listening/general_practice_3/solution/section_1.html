    <p>You will hear a man asking for information about lan guage classes over the phone.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Woman: Good morning. <span class="explainqe explain">globetrotters&nbsp; </span>Language School. How may I help you?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Yes, I was wondering if you could give me some information on language classes.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Certainly. What language are you interested in studying?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Well, that’s the thing. I’m interested in learning japanese, but I’d also like to improve my Chinese. I don’t know which to study right now.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Maybe the class schedule will help you decide. Did you want to study in the morning, afternoon, or evening?<br>
        <br>
        Man: I work in the evenings, so mornings or afternoons would be best.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Then that decides it for you. We offer an advanced Chinese class, but it meets on <span class="explainq1 explain">Wednesday and Friday </span>evenings.<br>
        <br>
        Man: I couldn’t do that. When do the Japanese classes meet?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: We have beginning Japanese on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, no wait, that’s <span class="explainq2 explain">intermediate </span>Japanese. Which level do you want? advanced?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Man: No, <span class="explainq3 explain">beginning</span>. Definitely. I know some Chinese and some French, but I’m a real beginner with Japanese.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Well then, are you free Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings? That’s when the beginning Japanese classes meet. We also have intermediate French on <span class="explainq4 explain">Friday mornings</span>.<br>
        <br>
        Man: I could do those mornings, but I’d prefer afternoon. Don’t you have anything in the afternoon?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: We have intermediate Japanese class on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.<br>
        <br>
        Man: I really need a beginner class. So I’ll take the morning Japanese class. Could you give me an idea of the cost? What would be the tuition for the Japanese class?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: The beginning-level classes meet three times a week, so they cost a bit more than the other levels. For a six-week course, the cost would be<span class="explainq7 explain"> five hundred and seventy five dollars.</span></p>

    <p><br>
        Man: That’s a bit steep.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: If it’s hard for you to pay that much, you could sign up for just four weeks of class and <span class="explainq6 explain">pay four hundred and ten dollars.</span> Or, you could pay for one week at a time, at <span class="explainq5 explain">a hundred and twenty five dollars</span> a week.<br>
        <br>
        Man: That comes out to be much more expensive once you add up all the weeks.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Woman: That’s true. You can save money by registering for two levels together. For example, pay for your beginning and intermediate classes now and you’ll get twelve weeks of class for just<span class="explainq8 explain"> one thousand and fifty dollars.</span><br>
        <br>
        Man: That’s not a bad deal, but I can’t come up with that much money at once. I'll just pay for the six week course.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Fine. That class begins next week, so you need to register right away.<br>
        <br>
        Man: Can’t I register over the phone?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: No, I’m sorry, we don’t take phone registrations. What you’ll need to do is visit <span class="explainq9 explain">the school office</span> today or tomorrow. Bring a check for the tuition and a photo id<br>
        <br>
        Man: Is that all?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Yes, we’ll give you a registration form to complete, or you can save time by visiting our website and&nbsp; downloading the form there. Complete it and bring it into the office with your check.<br>
        <br>
        Man: Great. I’ll stop by this afternoon.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Fine. When you arrive, ask for <span class="explainq10 explain">Mr. Lindsay</span>. He’s in charge of student registration.<br>
        <br>
        Man: I’m sorry, Mr. who?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Mr. Lindsay, spelled L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.<br>
        <br>
        Man: Thank you for your help.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Thank you. We’ll look forward to seeing you in class.</p>
