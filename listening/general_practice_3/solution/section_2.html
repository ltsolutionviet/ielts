    <p>You will hear a tour guide giving information about a shopping district.<br>
        <br>
        Tour guide: This afternoon we’ll visit the city’s shopping&nbsp;district&nbsp;. Several blocks in the area are closed to car&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;, and I know you’ll enjoy walking around there. I’d like to give you an overview of the district now since you’ll be on your own once we get there.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="explainq11 explain">You’ll see on this map here that the shopping district&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of two streets - Pear Street, which runs north and south, and&nbsp;cherry street&nbsp;, which crosses Pear Street right here. Let’s start our tour here on Pear Street where the star is. This star marks the Harbor View&nbsp;bookstore.</span> It’s very popular among locals as well as&nbsp;tourists&nbsp;. You can buy a range of books of local interest as well as a variety of magazines and newspapers. It’s directly across the street from the City Library, which is also&nbsp;worth&nbsp;a visit. It’s in one of the oldest buildings in the city and&nbsp;contains&nbsp;, among other things, an interesting collection of rare books.<br>
        <br>
        Now, moving up Pear from the bookstore toward Cherry, <span class="explainq12 explain">the next building on the left is the Pear Cafe</span>. You’ll notice it’s right on the corner of Pear and Cherry streets. It’s a great place to relax while enjoying a&nbsp;delicious&nbsp;cup of coffee or tea. You can talk with friends or read quietly. They have a&nbsp;variety&nbsp;of books and magazines available.<br>
        <br>
        From the windows of the cafe, you can look right across Cherry Street for a lovely view of&nbsp;city gardens&nbsp;. It’s a rather small garden, but it contains a variety of&nbsp;exotic&nbsp;plants and flowers.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s leave the cafe and cross Pear Street. On the opposite&nbsp;corner&nbsp;, we’re at Caldwell’s Clothing Store, which you might also want to visit. They sell both men’s and women’s fashions from countries around the world.<br>
        <br>
        Continuing down Cherry Street, <span class="explainq13 explain">the next building on the right after Caldwell’s is the&nbsp;souvenir shop&nbsp;</span>. Stop in here to get maps and books about the local area, as well as T-shirts and&nbsp;postcards&nbsp;with pictures of the city.<span class="explainq14 explain"> Now, we cross Cherry Street and we’re at the art&nbsp;gallery&nbsp;, one building down from the corner.</span> Here you can see and, of course,&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;many fine paintings and&nbsp;sculptures&nbsp;by local artists.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s keep going down Cherry Street toward the harbor. <span class="explainq15 explain">On the left, right after the gallery, is Harbor Park.</span> It’s a lovely place, and it’s certainly worth spending some time there.<br>
        <br>
        Harbor Park was built on land&nbsp;donated&nbsp;to the city by Captain Jones, a lifelong resident of this city. Captain Jones designed the park himself, and it was built in&nbsp;<span class="explainq16 explain">1876</span>&nbsp;. Exactly in the center of the park a <span class="explainq17 explain">statue </span>of Captain Jones was&nbsp;erected&nbsp;, and it’s still standing there today. It shows Captain Jones on the bow of his ship.<br>
        <br>
        After viewing the statue, you can follow the path that goes through the <span class="explainq18 explain">woods </span>just behind. It will lead you to a lovely garden, in the middle of which is a <span class="explainq19 explain">fountain</span>. This is a nice place to enjoy a few quiet moments.<br>
        <br>
        If you still feel like walking, continue on to the far end of the garden. There, you’ll find a wooden&nbsp;<span class="explainq20 explain">staircase&nbsp;</span>, which will take you down to the&nbsp;harbor&nbsp;. You might enjoy the view of the&nbsp;boats&nbsp;from there. There’s also a walking path along the water, which will eventually bring you back up to Cherry Street.<br>
        <br>
        You can see that there’s&nbsp;plenty&nbsp;to do in this part of the city. The bus leaves at&nbsp;1:30&nbsp;.</p>
