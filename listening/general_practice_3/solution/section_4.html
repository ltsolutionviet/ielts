    <p>You will hear a lecture about wind energy.<br>
        <br>
        Lecturer: With the rising cost of&nbsp;fossil fuels&nbsp;, there’s a great deal of interest these days in developing&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;sources of energy. Today, I’d like to talk about one of these&nbsp;wind power. In the past couple of&nbsp;decades&nbsp;, there’s been an&nbsp;upsurge&nbsp;of interest in using the wind as a source of energy, but the idea isn’t new at all. People have been&nbsp;harnessing&nbsp;the power of the wind for centuries, ever since ancient peoples first used&nbsp;sailboats&nbsp;. In ancient China, farmers used a rudimentary sort of&nbsp;windmill&nbsp;to <span class="explainq31 explain">pump water</span>. Wind power was used in other parts of the&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;world, as well. In Persia, for example, farmers used&nbsp;wind powered&nbsp;mills to<span class="explainq32 explain"> grind their grain</span>. During the Middle Ages in the Netherlands, people went back to the ancient idea of using the power of the wind to move water. They used windmills to <span class="explainq33 explain">drain lakes</span>, thereby creating more land for farming.<br>
        <br>
        Lecturer: At present, people around the world are using the wind to generate electricity, some old methods, some new. Is this the solution to our modern energy problems? Well, as with anything, there are both&nbsp;advantages&nbsp;and disadvantages to using wind power. Let’s take a look at some of the reasons to use wind power. One of the biggest problems with using fuels such as&nbsp;oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;coal&nbsp;is <span class="explainq34 explain">pollution</span>. Wind power, on the other hand, is clean. It causes no pollution and therefore doesn’t contribute to&nbsp;global warming&nbsp;. Another great advantage of wind power is that it’s a&nbsp;<span class="explainq35 explain">renewable resource&nbsp;</span>. Oil and coal reserves are limited, but we'll never run out of wind. Economics is&nbsp;another&nbsp;reason to use wind power. Using the wind to generate electricity<span class="explainq37 explain"> costs less,</span> much less, than running other types of generators. In addition, since wind&nbsp;turbines don’t take up much land, the land around them can be used for other purposes, such as farming.<br>
        <br>
        There are disadvantages, however. Even though generating electricity with wind is relatively&nbsp;inexpensive&nbsp;, the technology isn’t cheap. The initial costs of setting up wind turbines can be quite high. Another issue is&nbsp;reliability&nbsp;. Wind doesn’t blow at a&nbsp;constant of&nbsp;<span class="explainq36 explain">strength.</span> Therefore, at times, a lot of electricity can be produced while at others there may be little or none. Wind turbines usually have to be located in&nbsp;rural&nbsp;areas where the land is open. Their distance from <span class="explainq38 explain">cities</span>, where the most electricity is needed, is another issue. Although wind is&nbsp;considered&nbsp;to be a clean source of energy, wind turbines cause their own sort of pollution. Wind turbines are usually placed in high, open areas, where they’re easy to be seen.&nbsp;rural residents&nbsp;often feel that the beautiful local&nbsp;<span class="explainq39 explain">scenery&nbsp;</span>is&nbsp;spoiled&nbsp;by the sight of the wind turbines. In addition, wind turbines aren’t quiet. In fact, one wind turbine can produce as much<span class="explainq40 explain"> noise</span> as a car traveling at&nbsp;highway&nbsp;speeds.</p>
