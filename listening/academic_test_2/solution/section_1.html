<div class="passage-content"> <h1 class="text-align-justify"><strong>SECTION 1</strong></h1>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Good morning. I’ve been looking at your holidays to Aus­tralia in your <span class="explainqe explain">brochure</span>. I’m thinking of going during the second half of next month.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Good morning. As you can see from our brochure, we offer a wide variety of packages to various destinations in Aus­tralia. Is there anything in particular that interests you?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes, my husband and I are very interested in the holidays in the Outback.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: These holidays are becoming increasingly popular. Would you like to arrange flights and accommodation with us, or just accommodation?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Can you arrange flights from Sydney?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Certainly.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: OK, <span class="explainq1 explain">flights</span> and accommodation then.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Right. You said that you wanted to travel next month. Which date would you prefer? I should point out that there are no daily flights available, so if you have a flexible itinerary, that’s better.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Well, we arrive in Sydney on the 15<sup>th</sup>of <span class="explainq2 explain">April</span> and we were thinking of travelling to the Outback on the 18<sup>th</sup>of August, er... I mean April.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: OK. There’s only one flight from Sydney to Alice Springs on the 18<sup>th</sup>, so I’ll book you on that. It leaves at 10&nbsp; in the morning, which is quite convenient. Shall I book two seats for you?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes, please.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: As for your stay in the Outback, you can see from the bro­chure that we offer three packages - budget, standard, and luxury. The budget package is about 500 Australian dollars. The standard package is about 700 and the luxury&nbsp;one is approximately 1,000, though it does depend on exactly what you would like regarding extras. Which one would you prefer?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Well, we can’t decide between the <span class="explainq3 explain">budget</span> and standard options.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Ah, well, actually, just looking at my computer here, on the date that you want to fly into Alice Springs, there is no standard accommodation available. It’s fully booked, I’m afraid.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: That’s OK. We think that the <span class="explainq3 explain">cheapest</span> one should be fine for us. We don’t mind roughing it for a few days and we don’t expect to be spending much time at the accom­modation. We prefer the outdoors.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Right. Let’s look at the room options. First of all, would you prefer a <span class="explainq4 explain">non-smoking</span> room?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes. Neither of us smokes.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: OK.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Oh, before I forget, could you book everything in my husband's name, please?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">YMan: es, of course. Are you paying by credit card?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: In that case, I’ll need your husband’s name exactly as it appears on the card.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Of course. It’s <span class="explainq5 explain">John A. Smyth</span>. That’s Smyth with a “Y”.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: John ... middle initial “A”... surname Smyth, S-M-Y-T-H. Is that correct?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Correct.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Thank you. I’ll just check the price. The room will cost 100 dollars a night plus 10 dollars tax, so <span class="explainq6 explain">110 dollars</span> per night in total. Is that OK?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes, that’s fine. Book us for three nights, please.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Most of the guests like to participate in some special ac­tivities and trips while they are staying in the Outback. Is there anything that interests you and your husband?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes, there are several things we’d like to see and do. We’d definitely like to visit the <span class="explainq7 explain">Cultural Centre</span>.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Yes, that’s very popular. It’s within walking distance of the accommodation and it’s free. It’s also a great place to pick up souvenirs of your trip.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: We were thinking about visiting one of the nearby farms.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: There are two farms nearby - a sheep farm and a kanga­roo farm. There is also an opportunity to ride camels in the desert. Have you ridden a camel before?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: No, but it sounds like fun. Could you give me some more details about the kangaroo farm and the <span class="explainq8 explain">camel ride</span>?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Certainly. The kangaroo farm includes information on how the animals are raised whilst the camel ride provides information on desert flora and fauna. Which would you prefer? You can arrange to see the kangaroos in the wild if you like, rather than on a farm.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: That sounds perfect. OK, we’ll go on the camel ride and see the kangaroos in their natural habitat.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: OK. I’ll arrange that for you. I forgot to mention that the journey also includes a stop at a place of aboriginal art­work. It’s a place well-known for its stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: That sounds great! Are the carvings in the <span class="explainq9 explain">desert</span>?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Yes.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Wonderful!</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Well, that’s perfect then. I’m sure you'll have a lovely trip, but remember that you need take care in the sun.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes. We’re really looking forward to our trip. We really want to try to experience the Dreamtime under the <span class="explainq10 explain">stars</span>.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Man: Of course. That’s what a trip to the Outback is really all about.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">Woman: Yes. Now, how about the cost...</p>
