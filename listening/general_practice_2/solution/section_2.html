    <p class="text-align-justify">You will hear a hike leader giving information about an upcoming hiking trip.<br>
        <br>
        Hike leader: Good evening, everyone. As you know, this is our last meeting before we&nbsp;set off on our&nbsp;annual&nbsp;week-long hiking trip, so tonight I’ll be telling you everything you’ll need to know to be ready for the trip. Let’s talk about&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;first. Having the right equipment is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;for your comfort and safety. First, you’ll need a warm and&nbsp;comfortable<span class="explainq11 explain">&nbsp;sleeping bag&nbsp;. </span>However, you won’t need to worry about carrying a&nbsp;tent&nbsp;since we’ll be sleeping in&nbsp;shelters along the way. Also, part of the fee you’ve paid for the trip goes toward food, so you won’t need to put that on your packing list either. We’ve found, though, that it’s more&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;for each person to bring his or her own&nbsp;<span class="explainq12 explain">dishes&nbsp;</span>, ​​​so be sure to pack a&nbsp;plastic bowl&nbsp;, a cup, and a fork, knife, and spoon. That’s all you’ll need in the way of dishes.<br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the most important item to put on your list is a comfortable pair of&nbsp;<span class="explainq13 explain">hiking boots</span>&nbsp;. Nothing ruins a hike more than getting&nbsp;blisters&nbsp;and sores from&nbsp;ill-fitting&nbsp;boots. So make sure your boots fit you right. Shoes and sneakers aren’t&nbsp;adequate&nbsp;for the type of hiking we’ll be doing. Of course,<span class="explainq14 explain"> a&nbsp;backpack&nbsp;</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is necessary for carrying your equipment. Make sure you have one that’s&nbsp;lightweight&nbsp;and comfortable to carry. Walking poles have become popular among hikers recently, but we don’t recommend them. They can get in the way when too many hikers are using them at once, and some serious&nbsp;injuries&nbsp;have been caused, so it’s best to leave those at home.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s see…What else? Oh, yes. Some people have asked me about&nbsp;trail maps&nbsp;. They’re available, but you really don’t need them, as your hike leaders have scouted out the trail and will be&nbsp;guiding&nbsp;you along the way. And don’t forget to bring a&nbsp;warm <span class="explainq15 explain">jacket&nbsp;</span>. You may think you won’t need one in this warm summer weather, but remember that evenings in the mountains can get quite cold. Is there anything else I need to tell you? Oh, yes, your guides will each be carrying a first- aid kit, so that’s one less thing for you to pack&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;. Remember, you’ll be carrying your backpack all day, so keep your load light and don’t&nbsp;over pack.<br>
        <br>
        I know you’re all experienced hikers, bur it’s always worth&nbsp;repeating&nbsp;the rules of the trail since they’re so important. These rules are in place for the safety of everyone on the trip. As you know, there’ll be a hike leader walking at the head of the line, who will show the group the way. At the end of the line will be the <span class="explainq16 explain">rear leader, or&nbsp;sweep</span>. It’s important to always stay ahead of this person while we re on the trail. There are several different trails on the&nbsp;mountainwhere we’ll be hiking, and they cross each other at some points. When you come to any&nbsp;<span class="explainq17 explain">intersection&nbsp;</span>of trails, stop and wait for the rest of the group to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;. This way we can be sure that no one goes off on the wrong trail. Let me&nbsp;emphasize&nbsp;here how important it is to stay on the trail. We’ll be climbing through some steep and&nbsp;rocky&nbsp;areas. Don’t be tempted to go off on your own and try to climb some <span class="explainq18 explain">rocks</span>. That can be quite&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;. Also, it’s not likely, but it is possible that we’ll&nbsp;encounter&nbsp;some large wild animals along the way. The last thing you want to do is try to <span class="explainq19 explain">feed </span>any of them. That will just encourage them to follow us, which could lead to some dangerous&nbsp;situations&nbsp;. One last thing: Before we set off hiking each morning, be sure to fill up your <span class="explainq20 explain">water </span>bottle. This is perhaps the most important safety rule.&nbsp;dehydration&nbsp;can be a serious problem when you’re out in the&nbsp;wilderness&nbsp;, so you must always be sure to carry an adequate supply of water with you.<br>
        <br>
        I think that covers just about everything. Are there any questions?</p>
