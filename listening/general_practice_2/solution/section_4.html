    <p>You will hear a lecture about customer psychology.<br>
        <br>
        Lecture: An understanding of customer&nbsp;psychology&nbsp;is an invaluable aid for retailers looking for ways to increase sales. Much can be done to the store environment to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;shoppers to linger longer and spend more money. The first aspect to consider is the&nbsp;physicalorganization of the store. Placement of&nbsp;merchandise&nbsp;has a great deal of influence on what customers buy. For example,<span class="explainq31 explain"> a common practice among&nbsp;retailers&nbsp;is to place the store’s bestselling merchandise near the back of the store</span>. In order to get to these popular items from the front&nbsp;entrance&nbsp;, customers have to&nbsp;walk down&nbsp;aisles filled with merchandise that they might not see otherwise.&nbsp;carpets&nbsp;are also used to direct customers through particular areas of the store. Retailers choose carpets not only for their&nbsp;decorative&nbsp;or comfort value, but also <span class="explainq32 explain">because lines or other types of&nbsp;patterns&nbsp;in the carpets can&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;guide shoppers in certain directions</span>. <span class="explainq33 explain">Besides encouraging shoppers to go to certain areas of the store, retailers also want to keep them in the store longer</span>. One way to do this is to provide comfortable seating&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the store, but not too close to the doors. This gives customers a&nbsp;chance&nbsp;to rest and then continue shopping.<br>
        <br>
        Retailers can do a number of things to create a pleasant&nbsp;atmosphere&nbsp;in the store, thereby encouraging more&nbsp;purchases&nbsp;.<span class="explainq34 explain"> Music is commonly used, not as entertainment, but as a&nbsp;calming&nbsp;influence. It can slow the customers’ pace through the store, making them spend more time shopping and,&nbsp;consequentially&nbsp;, making more purchases. </span>Scent’s are also used in&nbsp;various&nbsp;ways. Everyone has had the experience of being drawn into a bakery by the smell of&nbsp;fresh bread&nbsp;. Experiments have been done with other types of&nbsp;sense&nbsp;, as well. For example, <span class="explainq35 explain">the scent of&nbsp;vanilla&nbsp;has been used to increase sales in clothing stores.</span><br>
        <br>
        Lccturer: Use of color is another important&nbsp;aspect&nbsp;of store environment.<br>
        <br>
        Certain colors can affect behavior as well as mood. Light&nbsp;purple&nbsp;, for example, has been found to have an interesting effect on customer behavior. People shopping in an environment where light purple is the&nbsp;predominating&nbsp;color seem to <span class="explainq36 explain">spend money</span> more than shoppers in other environments. Orange is a color that’s often used in&nbsp;fast-food&nbsp;restaurants. It encourages customers to <span class="explainq37 explain">leave faster</span>, making room for the next group of diners. Blue, on the other hand, is a&nbsp;calming color&nbsp;. It gives customers a sense of <span class="explainq38 explain">security</span>, so it’s a good color for any business to use. In addition to using color to create mood and affect customer&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;, color can also be used to&nbsp;attract&nbsp;certain kinds of customers to a business. Stores that cater to a younger&nbsp;clientele&nbsp;should use bold, bright colors, which tend to be&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;to <span class="explainq39 explain">younger people.</span> Stores that are interested in attracting an older clientele will have more success with soft, subtle colors, as <span class="explainq40 explain">older people</span> find these colors more&nbsp;appealing&nbsp;.</p>
