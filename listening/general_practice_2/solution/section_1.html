    <p class="text-align-justify">You will hear a woman asking for information over the phone.<br>
        <br>
        Man: Good afternoon.&nbsp;<span class="explainqe explain">plainfield&nbsp;</span>Community Center.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Yes, hi. I’m new in town, and I was&nbsp;curious&nbsp;about the services the Community Center has to offer.<br>
        <br>
        Man: We offer a variety of&nbsp;recreational&nbsp;activities. What were you interested in, in particular?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Well, everything, I guess. OK, let’s start with kids. I have a&nbsp;teenage&nbsp;son. What activities do you have for teens?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Right now, during the school year, we have <span class="explainq1 explain">tutoring&nbsp;sessions</span>&nbsp;for children and teens, in all subjects.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: That would be good. He needs help with&nbsp;algebra&nbsp;.<br>
        <br>
        Man: We can certainly help with that. Just have him come by any Wednesday or Saturday afternoon. That’s when the tutoring sessions are&nbsp;scheduled&nbsp;.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Fantastic. What about sports? Do you have sports activities for teens?<br>
        <br>
        Man: <span class="explainq2 explain">We have&nbsp;tennis lessons&nbsp;on Sunday mornings for teens and Sunday afternoons for adults. </span><br>
        Woman: Hmmm, I don’t think my son would like that, but my husband might. For myself, I’d be more interested in&nbsp;yoga&nbsp;. Do you offer yoga classes?<br>
        <br>
        Man: We do. Our yoga classes take place on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. We&nbsp;divide&nbsp;it up into several groups, so there’s one class for younger children, <span class="explainq3 explain">one for teens, and one for adults.</span><br>
        <br>
        Woman: Really? I doubt my husband and son would be interested, but I’d like to sign up for <span class="explainq4 explain">yoga</span>. I also like reading. Do you have any book clubs?<br>
        <br>
        Man: We have one just about to start. The first meeting will be next Friday morning. It will focus on early&nbsp;20th century&nbsp;novels.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Too bad it’s Friday morning. I think my son would enjoy it, but of course he’s in school at that time.<br>
        <br>
        Man: Well, actually, <span class="explainq5 explain">that book club is for adults only</span>. We may start one up for teens next summer, but we have nothing for that age group right now.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Oh, well. I suppose he has enough to keep him busy for now. Now, what about&nbsp;fees&nbsp;? Do these classes and activities cost anything?<br>
        <br>
        Man: There’s a small charge for&nbsp;non-members&nbsp;for each class. However, they’re all free to members. Would you be interested in becoming a member?<br>
        <br>
        Woman: How much does the&nbsp;membership&nbsp;cost?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Not much at all. <span class="explainq6 explain">The yearly fee is&nbsp;seventy five dollars&nbsp;</span>for individuals and&nbsp;<span class="explainq7 explain">two hundred and twenty-five dollars&nbsp;for families.</span><br>
        <br>
        Woman: What do I get with the membership?<br>
        <br>
        Man: You get free access to all classes and activities, and you can use our facilities, like the tennis court, the exercise room, and the meeting room.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: It’s not a bad deal, really. Could you tell me exactly where the cen¬ter is&nbsp;located&nbsp;?<br>
        <br>
        Man: It’s at 107 [one-oh-seven]<span class="explainq8 explain"> Eliot Street.</span><br>
        <br>
        Woman: Is that Eliot with two Ls or one L?<br>
        <br>
        Man: One L. E-L-I-O-T. It’s right downtown.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: I think I know where it is. Do you have&nbsp;free parking&nbsp;?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Yes. You can park just <span class="explainq9 explain">across the street</span>. There’s a&nbsp;garage&nbsp;there.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: That sounds easy enough. Maybe I’ll come in one day next week and sign up for some classes.<br>
        <br>
        Man: That would be fine, but don’t come on <span class="explainq10 explain">Monday </span>because we’re closed that day. We’re open Tuesday through Sunday.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: Oh. Thanks for telling me. Maybe I’ll stop in on Tuesday then. Can I pay for the classes with a&nbsp;personal check&nbsp;?<br>
        <br>
        Man: We accept checks and credit cards.<br>
        <br>
        Woman: OK. Thank you very much. You’ve been very helpful.</p>
