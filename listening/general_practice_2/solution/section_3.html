<div class="passage-content">

    <p>You will hear a conversation between a university student and a faculty advisor about the requirements for the student teaching semester.<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: I’d like to go over with you today some of the&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;for your student teaching, which you’ll be&nbsp;undertaking&nbsp;next semester.<br>
        <br>
        Student: I’m really looking forward to working in a real classroom and teaching children, but I’m&nbsp;nervous&nbsp;about it, too.<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: One of my roles is to provide you with whatever support you may require. One thing that helps me do that is to know what you’re doing in the classroom,<span class="explainq21 explain"> so I require all my students to keep a journal about their teaching&nbsp;experience&nbsp;.</span></p>

    <p>Student: <span class="explainq21 explain">That sounds like a lot of work.</span> Will I have to write in it every day?</p>

    <p>Advisor: <span class="explainq22 explain">Yes, if you can. You’ll give it to me at the end of each week. Another thing I’ll want from you is a few sample lesson plans. </span>I’ll let you know ahead of time&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;how I want you to do them.<br>
        <br>
        Student: Several of us from the university will be student teaching at the same school. Are we&nbsp;supposed&nbsp;to get together regularly to&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;our work?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: I’ll meet with each student teacher&nbsp;individually&nbsp;, but you aren’t required to meet with each other. Of course, you can talk together as much as you want. You will, however,<span class="explainq23 explain"> have to&nbsp;observe&nbsp;some of the other teachers in the school, </span>besides the teacher you’ll be working with.<br>
        <br>
        Student: Then will I get an&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;from my supervising teacher at the end of the semester?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: Actually, no. I’ll do your evaluation, and I’ll base it on several things.<span class="explainq24 explain"> One is your required&nbsp;portfolio&nbsp;</span>​​​​​​​, which should contain samples of your class&nbsp;activities&nbsp;and your students’ work. Another important thing is your term paper.<br>
        <br>
        Student: Then there won’t be a final exam?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: No, we don’t feel that’s&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;for student teaching.<br>
        <br>
        Student: I know I have to get an agreement form signed. Since you’re my&nbsp;advisor&nbsp;, are you the one to do that?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: No, that form is for you<span class="explainq25 explain">r&nbsp;supervising&nbsp;teacher</span> to sign, to document that he or she agrees to have you in the classroom as a student teacher.<br>
        <br>
        Student: Oh, I see. I’m concerned about the term paper I’ll have to do, and the&nbsp;evaluationprocess. I’m not sure I understand what I’m supposed to do.<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: Regarding the term paper, the first thing is to choose a topic. It should be&nbsp;related&nbsp;to your teaching work. You should let me know your <span class="explainq26 explain">term paper topic</span> by the end of the first week of the&nbsp;semester&nbsp;.<br>
        <br>
        Student: Will you be observing me regularly in the classroom?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: Yes, and during the fourth week of the semester, we'll have our <span class="explainq27 explain">first evaluation</span> meeting to discuss my&nbsp;observations&nbsp;.<br>
        <br>
        Student: One thing I’m really looking forward to is the <span class="explainq28 explain">student teacher&nbsp;conference</span>&nbsp;that the university puts on every year.<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: I’m glad you’re looking forward to it. Of course, everyone in the program is required to&nbsp;attend&nbsp;. The conference takes place, let me check, yes, the&nbsp;seventh week&nbsp;of the semester.<br>
        <br>
        Student: When will 1 have to turn in my term paper?<br>
        <br>
        Advisor: The <span class="explainq29 explain">term paper</span> is due by the end of the fourteenth week of the semester. Then during the&nbsp;15th&nbsp;and final week, we’ll get together one last time for a <span class="explainq30 explain">semester review.</span>​​​​​​​<br>
        <br>
        Student: Wow. It looks like I have a busy semester ahead of me.</p>
