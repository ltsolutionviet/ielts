<div id="set-container-1" class="tab-section-reading active"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 1</h1><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: Good morning, you’re through to the events coordinator at the Birmingham City ouncil, how may I help you?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there, my husband and I are interested in <span class="explainqe explain">purchasing tickets</span> to the automobile exhibition, but I couldn’t find many details about it on your website, and I was&nbsp;wondering whether you could provide me with some more&nbsp;information. Does it open in June?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: Yes, of course, Madam. The exhibition will take place during <span class="explainq1 explain">July</span>, and will showcase the history of automobiles&nbsp;from the very first commercial car in the late 1800s all the&nbsp;way through to the present day.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the exhibition open for the duration of July?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: No, Madam, the exhibition will last <span class="explainq2 explain">3 days</span>, from the 1st of July to the 3rd of July, and then the cars will be taken to&nbsp;another exhibition.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Does the exhibition focus on a certain manufacturer?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: No, it will showcase a wide range of manufacturers.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful! I’m ever so fed up of going to these shows and only seeing one manufacturer. Are there any opportunities to sit in or even drive the cars?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: There will be many opportunities for you to sit in the cars; however, some of the cars will only be available to&nbsp;observe. We are yet to be told whether any of the antique&nbsp;cars will be available to drive, however there will certainly&nbsp;be an opportunity to <span class="explainq3 explain">test driving</span> some of the more modern&nbsp;cars on a purpose-built track.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like great fun! I mustn’t forget to bring my camera, or my husband will never forgive me!</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: I’m afraid to say that <span class="explainq4 explain">cameras </span>are actually strictly not allowed to bring into the exhibition. There will however be a&nbsp;section where a professional photographer will be available&nbsp;to take photos of you sitting in a car in period clothing.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that sounds like it could be fun, but I assume the photos won’t be free.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: On the contrary, one free photograph is included within every ticket, but each photo after this will cost £5.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s a nice surprise, not many things are free anymore. I’ve been asking around about the ticket prices, but I haven’t yet had a definite answer. Is it correct that the&nbsp;tickets are £100 whether you buy them now or on arrival?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: I’m afraid not. If you buy the ticket in advance the price is <span class="explainq5 explain">£110</span>, but it’s £165 on the door.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh goodness! I suppose I’d best pay for them now then. Is it possible to buy tickets from you now over the phone?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: Yes, of course, Madam. I’ll transfer you to the Box Office Manager, Mark <span class="explainq6 explain">Edgeworth</span>, that’s E-D-G-E-W-O-R-T-H,&nbsp;and he will probably need to take your credit card details&nbsp;and some personal details.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that’s fine. Before you transfer me, I just need to ask a few more questions. Will the exhibition be held in the Birmingham Exhibition Centre? I think that’s where I went&nbsp;last time.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: No, Madam, the Birmingham Exhibition Centre is currently undergoing some renovations, so this year all&nbsp;exhibitions will be held in the <span class="explainq7 explain">Summer </span>Palace.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer Palace? I’m not entirely sure where that is.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: Well, it’s not too far from <span class="explainq8 explain">city centre</span>. Once you’re in the centre, you should be able to find signs for the palace. If&nbsp;not, most people in Birmingham will be able to direct you.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm...neither my husband nor I am particularly good with directions. Is there anywhere I can find this information on the Internet?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: Our website will give you an address. Perhaps you could visit <span class="explainq9 explain">www.directions.com</span> for more detailed information,&nbsp;and they should be able to provide you with step-by-step&nbsp;instructions.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay and is this the best way to contact you, by phone?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Events Coordinator: I think the most convenient way to contact us is <span class="explainq10 explain">enquiring online</span>, which is much simpler than having to dial various&nbsp;different numbers to reach the right person! Unless you&nbsp;have any more questions, I’ll transfer you now.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Julie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that’s great! Thank you for your help.</p></div></div>
