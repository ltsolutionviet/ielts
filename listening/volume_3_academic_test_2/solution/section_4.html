<div id="set-container-4" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 4</h1><p class="text-align-justify">Great Britain is often hailed as the home of football, with talented players travelling from far and wide to play for teams in the English Premier League -one of the most popular football leagues on the planet. Today we are going&nbsp;to take a look back to the 19th century Great Britain in an attempt to trace the&nbsp;evolution of ‘the beautiful game’ as it is now known.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Prior to the 19th century, the game featured a wide variety of local and regional adaptations, which were later smartened up and made more uniform to create our modern-day sports of association football, rugby football, and Ireland’s Gaelic football. Even up to the mid-19th century, Shrovetide football or ‘mob football’&nbsp;was still widely practiced. According to the rules of mob football, there were no&nbsp;rules.. .a player could legally use any means whatsoever to obtain the ball, such&nbsp;as kicking, punching, biting and gouging, with the only exceptions being murder&nbsp;and manslaughter. These games may be regarded as the ancestors of modem&nbsp;codes of football, and by comparison with later models of football, they were&nbsp;chaotic and had few cooperation. Towards the latter end of the 19th century and&nbsp;moving into the early part of the 20th century, however,<span class="explainq31 explain"> there appeared a new&nbsp;found emphasis on moral values in football</span>. Perhaps a more modern example&nbsp;of this can be seen in John Terry’s suspension as England captain following&nbsp;reports of his infidelity to his wife. Furthermore, as mob football died away,&nbsp;<span class="explainq32 explain">there grew a greater concern for players’ health and general well-being, with&nbsp;many clubs affording their top players access to frequent medical check-ups and&nbsp;treatment. </span>Despite the presence of Great Britain’s unique state-funded National&nbsp;Health Service, football clubs are still seen today providing team members with&nbsp;State-of-the-art healthcare facilities, with the top clubs even housing their own&nbsp;specialist doctors and physicians.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Today, football is a key feature of school children’s day-to-day education, particularly for boys. With the help of football associations, all schools in the&nbsp;UK are boasting their own football teams. This mainly comes as a result of&nbsp;pressure put on schools and the government by concerned <span class="explainq33 explain">parents</span>, who felt that&nbsp;football education taught their children valuable lessons and indeed vital life&nbsp;skills, such as teamwork and the&nbsp;drive to succeed. Nowadays, many of the UK’s&nbsp;top football clubs provide training facilities and outreach programmes in an&nbsp;attempt to educate the nation’s aspiring youths.</p><p class="text-align-justify">As I previously mentioned, it was only during the 19th century that football in its uniform concept truly began to emerge, with footballers previously playing&nbsp;according to their own <span class="explainq34 explain">versions </span>of the rules. However, it was not until the early&nbsp;20th century that different players actually began to play according to these&nbsp;standardised rules. Prior to the 19th century, football was played by all the major&nbsp;English public schools including the likes of Eton College, Winchester College,&nbsp;and Harrow. In 1848 there was a meeting at Cambridge University in an attempt&nbsp;to lay down the laws of football. Present at the meeting were representatives&nbsp;of each of these major public schools, whom each brought a copy of the rules enforced by their own individual school’s rules of football. The result of the meeting was what is now known as the ‘Cambridge Rules’, thereby uniting&nbsp;the rules from across the <span class="explainq35 explain">country </span>into one simple document. However, the&nbsp;Cambridge Rules were not liked by all, and a new set of rules, ‘Thring’s Rules’&nbsp;compounded in the book ‘The Simplest Game’ became common place among&nbsp;dissenters.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Across the country, improvements in infrastructure and public <span class="explainq36 explain">transport </span>had a knock on effect of dramatically increasing attendance to football games. Football&nbsp;quickly became a <span class="explainq37 explain">social </span>event where spectators would meet friends, drink tea&nbsp;and chat about the good old days. As football became more and more popular,&nbsp;it was decided that more money should be invested in maintaining the quality&nbsp;of pitches amongst other things, and there was even talk of installing seating for&nbsp;spectators. However, the question of who was to foot the bill quickly became a&nbsp;divisive issue, with many believing that the government should fund football’s&nbsp;development as a national sport. But in the end, the onus fell upon Britain’s&nbsp;local and regional football clubs for the <span class="explainq38 explain">funding </span>and development of the football&nbsp;association. They became responsible for the upkeep of football grounds, began&nbsp;to pay their best players a small salary, and organised <span class="explainq39 explain">competitions </span>against other&nbsp;local and regional teams. And there began England’s Football Association, or&nbsp;the FA, as we know it in its current form, the governing body of football in&nbsp;England. As the FA continued to grow and accumulate greater wealth, it was&nbsp;able to attract more and more talented young men from across the country,&nbsp;before finally accepting <span class="explainq40 explain">professional </span>talent in the early 20th century. Today,&nbsp;football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people&nbsp;regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions&nbsp;more watch the game on television or on the Internet, [fade out]</p></div></div>
