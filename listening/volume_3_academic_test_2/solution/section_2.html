<div id="set-container-2" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1>SECTION 2</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to the home page for the Healthy Hearing Medical Clinic and Surgery, where we’d like to share a little more information about the&nbsp;services we provide and more.</p><p>Our hospital is one of the leading specialised hospitals in the United Kingdom, attracting the very best healthcare professionals from around the globe. Not only&nbsp;are we a leading medical practice, but we are also the only hospital in the United&nbsp;Kingdom dedicated entirely to the treatment of, and research into the curing of hearing loss. Our facilities and staff here are renowned across Europe, attracting thousands of patients a year. <span class="explainq11 explain">Our consultations can number anything up to&nbsp;11,000 patients a year, however we aim to treat around 5,000 patients a year so&nbsp;as to maintain and ensure the quality of our services.</span> Our patients are guaranteed&nbsp;the highest standard of care, as well as the use of our first class facilities. All&nbsp;patients requiring overnight treatment are provided with their own private room&nbsp;with en-suite facilities, as well as a state-of-the-art entertainment centre, which&nbsp;includes a flat screen LCD television and Playstation.</p><p><span class="explainq12 explain">Appointments with our healthcare professionals can be made at any time during the week, with female doctors available between 8 am and 11 am.</span> If you need&nbsp;to see a doctor outside of these times, please visit the ‘Out of Hours’ page of our&nbsp;website for more information. Our doctors are all trained to an exceptionally&nbsp;high standard, and practice a vast array of specialties: Mr. Robert is a fully&nbsp;qualified ear and throat specialist, Mr. Edwards is a pediatric hearing specialist,&nbsp;<span class="explainq13 explain">while Mr. Green specialises in reversing hearing loss.</span> For more details about our&nbsp;people, please visit the ‘Staff Members’ page on our website.</p><p>During a consultation, doctors will sometimes decide medication is required, for which patients should receive a prescription. There are several pharmacies&nbsp;within the city; <span class="explainq14 explain">however we recommend that patients use the pharmacy housed&nbsp;within our health care facility.</span> Our in-house pharmacy is well-stocked at all&nbsp;times, our products are competitively priced, and our pharmacists are on hand&nbsp;to help and advise from 8 am until 10 pm from Monday to Saturday, and from&nbsp;9 am until 12 pm on Sundays. If you require any help outside of these hours,&nbsp;please see our ‘Out of Hours’ page on the website.</p><p>Since the Healthy Hearing Medical Clinic and Surgery also functions as a teaching hospital, we aim to provide our students with every opportunity&nbsp;to expose themselves to medicine in practice. <span class="explainq15 explain">Therefore we would like to&nbsp;encourage our patients to give their consent for a medical student to attend their&nbsp;consultations. </span>If our patients are not comfortable with this, there will be a form&nbsp;at reception where patients will be able to opt out.</p><p>Now, please look at the map I’ve given you of the Healthy Hearing Medical Clinic and Surgery. For those not familiar with our practice, <span class="explainq16 explain">reception can be found through the main door at the end of the corridor.</span> If your consultation is booked with Mr. Green, you need to go through the main door and turn right&nbsp;by the nurses’ desk, and <span class="explainq17 explain">his office is at the end of the corridor on your left-hand&nbsp;side</span>. If you need to alter any of your personal details, please visit our secretary&nbsp;at the Office for Medical Records, <span class="explainq18 explain">which you will find next to the therapy room.&nbsp;</span><span class="explainq19 explain">If you’re awaiting surgery, please first check in with reception, before taking&nbsp;the first door on the right after you enter the clinic</span>. Finally, in the event that you&nbsp;feel disappointed with any of the services we have provided, or have any further&nbsp;questions, <span class="explainq20 explain">please locate our Manager’s Office, which can be found near the&nbsp;Office for Medical Records and between two closets.</span></p><p>If you have any more questions about the Healthy Hearing Medical Clinic and Surgery, please do not hesitate to contact us on 01256 111 111.
