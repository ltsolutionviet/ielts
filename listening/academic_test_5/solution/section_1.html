<div class="passage-content"> <h1 class="text-align-justify"><strong>SECTION 1</strong></h1>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: Good afternoon and welcome to Habitat Hunters. You must be Joseph.<br>
RENTER: Yes, that’s right. You said on the phone that I could come by at 2:00. Sorry, I’m a little early.<br>
AGENT: No problem at all. In Calgary’s market, you have to move fast if you want a good apartment!<br>
RENTER: Actually, I’d settle for almost anything. I’ve been here ten days and the hotel is ruining me. My father has me on a strict budget.<br>
AGENT Sit right down here now, sir. Let’s talk a little about the places before we go have a look. Now, we have four apart­ments available.<br>
RENTER: OK, could you tell me more about those four apartments?<br>
AGENT: Sure. The first one is on Beatle Road, just a block off cam­pus. It’s a 3-bedroom with <span class="explainq1 explain">a bathroom</span> and a living room and a great Italian restaurant right next to it.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: How much?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: Well, it’s <span class="explainq2 explain">$435</span> a month, including Internet and utilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Any drawbacks to the house?<br>
AGENT: There’s a really big garden, but it hasn’t been taken care of over the years and is just too big to clean up nicely.<br>
RENTER: Hmm. That sounds okay. Tell me about the next option.<br>
AGENT: The other 3-bedroom apartment is on Oakington Avenue on campus. It is right near the building where you have classes, and the kitchen and living room are newly furnished.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: Wow, that sounds like a pretty good option.<br>
AGENT: Well, it is a cool apartment, but since it’s a dormitory, the living room, bathroom, kitchen, and <span class="explainq3 explain">washing machine</span> are&nbsp;all shared. It would be nice not to have to buy living room furniture, though.<br>
RENTER: And how much is this one?<br>
AGENT: $400 per month for a bedroom with an air conditioner. For a bedroom without an air conditioner, you would pay less, $340 for it.<br>
RENTER: Yikes, even with the air conditioner, it sounds really <span class="explainq4 explain">inconvenient</span> to have to share facilities. I’ll never cook if I have to walk down the hall to use the kitchen.<br>
AGENT: Yeah, that’s true. Anyway, the next place is a 2-bedroom on Mead Street.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: Oh, I like Mead Street - that’s off campus, right?<br>
AGENT: Yep. It’s pretty cool, but it only has 2 bedrooms, plus a liv­ing room and <span class="explainq5 explain">a study</span>.<br>
RENTER: But I want to live together with my two friends.<br>
AGENT: So you could make the study into a small bedroom if you end up living with them.<br>
RENTER: Also, we guys want a TV and DVD player since we’re all so much into movies.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: Well, this place has a great TV and VCR, but no DVD player.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: No DVD? That’s so weird. Are any other facilities provided?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: As you said, weird enough, it also comes with a <span class="explainq6 explain">washbasin</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: Is there a washing machine? I think we need that more than just a washbasin.<br>
AGENT: I'm afraid there’s no washing machine in the apartment.<br>
RENTER: Wow, that’s so old-fashioned! Maybe it’s not the best choice for three college guys. How much is it?<br>
AGENT: Well, it’s $600 per month, but of course it would be cheaper if you made it into 3 bedrooms instead of 2. Where is this apartment located?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: It’s 2500 Mead Street, where there are a lot of bars.<br>
RENTER: It would be affordable, but it would get pretty <span class="explainq7 explain">noisy</span>. And&nbsp;that sounds really expensive for an old place in a noisy area. How about the last place?<br>
AGENT: This one’s on-campus in the Devon Close complex. It’s a one-bedroom, so it will be a little quieter than the Mead Street place.<br>
RENTER: One bedroom, huh? That could be good for focusing on my studies. What else does it have?<br>
AGENT: It comes with a living room and a study, and includes a really nice lamp in the study that has a bunch of <span class="explainq8 explain">different&nbsp;settings</span>. You know what else is cool? There’s a dining hall downstairs so all <span class="explainq9 explain">evening meals</span> are free. You can purchase&nbsp;breakfast and lunch, but meals after 6 p.m. are free.<br>
Wow, this place sounds too good to be true. Is it really expensive?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: It’s alright - $500 per month, but there’s no <span class="explainq10 explain">bathroom</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">RENTER: What? No bathroom?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: Well, there’s no bathroom in the apartment, but there’s one at the end of the hall.<br>
RENTER: Hmm. Thanks, I think now I just have to decide whether I want to live alone or not.<br>
AGENT: Yeah, which one do you prefer?<br>
RENTER: I think I’d choose either this apartment or the one on Beatle Road.<br>
AGENT: OK. You’d better think about it, and then you can contact me ASAP.<br>
RENTER: Fine, thanks for your help!</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">AGENT: You’re welcome...</p>
