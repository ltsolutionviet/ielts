<p>RICKY: Hi, Julie, it’s Ricky.<br>
JULIE: Hi, Ricky, how are you? I noticed you weren’t in Psychology today.<br>
RICKY: I'm feeling sick, so I didn’t go to school today. Would you mind telling me what I missed in class?<br>
JULIE: Sure thing. I’m sorry you’re not feeling well! Anyway, we spent most of the class talking about a new essay that Pro­fessor Johnson assigned. You need to choose one of the bold headings from the <span class="explainq21 explain">note system</span> and research it.&nbsp;<br>
RICKY: Wow, I picked the wrong day to miss class, huh?</p>

<p>JULIE: You sure did.</p>

<p>RICKY: Could you tell me the specific requirements of this paper?</p>

<p>JULIE: Sure. You need to find <span class="explainq22 explain">scientific research</span> that supports your&nbsp;claim as one of your references. It can be from some of the case studies we discussed in class, or you can find your own.<br>
Or even better, you can conduct your own research! I’m sure that would get you an A.<br>
RICKY: Have you decided what you’re going to do yet? Also, where are you getting your references?<br>
JULIE: Yeah, I’m going to research facial recognition by infants. I’ve already found a few experiments in <span class="explainq23 explain">scientific journals</span>. That&nbsp;would probably be a good start for you - there are tons of journals in the library.<br>
RICKY: Great idea, thanks. I’m considering writing my essay on the effects of one of the psychotropic drugs we talked about in class. I’m sure there is lots of stuff about it on the Internet.<br>
Are we allowed to use <span class="explainq24 explain">information from the Internet</span>?&nbsp;<br>
JULIE: Sure, you can use that as long as it’s not your main source for information. You’ll probably want to cite some of the experi­ments we went over.<br>
RICKY: Good idea, thanks. I’m gonna try to find some information from a bunch of different sources.<br>
RICKY: Are there any specifications on how the essay should be written?<br>
JULIE: Yeah, Professor Johnson wants it <span class="explainq25 explain">double-spaced</span>. It should be&nbsp;between 6 to 10 pages long.<br>
RICKY: 6 to 10 pages? That’s so much! It’s going to take forever.</p>

<p>JULIE: I know. The whole class groaned when he said that. Anyway, you also need to put the title in <span class="explainq26 explain">italics</span>, and...&nbsp;</p>

<p>RICKY: Wait, each section heading, or just the main heading?<br>
JULIE: Only the main heading should be in italics. I think section titles are supposed to be in the same format, but maybe in bold. You’ll have to check that in class next time.<br>
RICKY: Oh okay. So I take it that the report has to be <span class="explainq27 explain">typed</span> since&nbsp;there are so many requirements. What are the other format­ting requirements?<br>
JULIE: Yep, it’s got to be typed. Aside from that, there are still a few more specifications. You should number each page, Make sure it goes up in the <span class="explainq28 explain">top right</span> corner.&nbsp;<br>
RICKY: Okay, I’ll make sure to write that down. I always forget to number the pages. Do we need to title and date each page, too?<br>
JULIE: You need the shortened title on every page, but no need to include the date. That should just be on the cover page.<br>
RICKY: Okay, thanks.<br>
JULIE: No problem. Also, make sure the margins are <span class="explainq29 explain">3.25</span> pixels&nbsp;wide..<br>
RICKY: What? I’m not even sure how to do that.<br>
JULIE: It’s okay, I can show you. It’s really easy. I think that’s all the directions he gave us. A lot of formatting requirements, but we have the freedom to research many things that we like, so that’s good. Oh, I almost forgot - remember to put down your <span class="explainq30 explain">ID number</span> on your report.&nbsp;<br>
RICKY: Thanks so much for your help. I’ll see you in class Monday!</p>

<p>JULIE: No problem, glad I could help. See you later.</p>
