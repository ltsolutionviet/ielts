<p><em>You will hear an extract from an audio guide to the Taj Mahal.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taj Mahal is the most popular tourist attraction in India. It is also one of the most </span><strong>spectacular</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buildings of the world, and is considered as a symbol of love. But how many people realise that it was actually built as a tomb or </span><strong>burial</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> place for the Emperor’s wife?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan to </span><strong>commemorate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal when she died, and, although this was not his original intention, for he had planned to build a black marble tomb for himself, <span class="explainq11 explain">they both lie side by side in the tomb</span> today. Emperor Shahjahan’s two greatest passions were architecture and jewellery and both are </span><strong>represented</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here in all their </span><strong>splendor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most skilled architects and </span><strong>craftsmen</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came from across India and countries as far away as Persia and Turkey. Much of the structure was built in white </span><strong>marble</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was carried by a thousand </span><strong>elephants</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the way from <span class="explainq12 explain">the Indian region of Rajasthan</span> some 300km away. Crystal and jade came from China, </span><strong>sapphires</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sri Lanka and turquoise from Tibet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a lot more to the Taj Mahal than just the tomb, so let’s have a look at the </span><strong>overall</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan before we take a walk through the </span><strong>magnificent</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gardens. Your tour begins here at the point marked with an X on the plan. This is known as <span class="explainq13 explain">The Main Gateway</span>. Walk through the gate and you come into an </span><strong>magnificent</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> garden. There are two marble </span><strong>canals </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">studded with fountains, which cross in the centre of the garden, dividing it into four </span><strong>equal</strong> <strong>squares</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each of these four quarters is then </span><strong>subdivided</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into flower beds. So there are <span class="explainq14 explain">16 flower beds</span> altogether. The tomb stands </span><strong>majestically</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the north end, not in the centre as you might have </span><strong>expected</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead, at the centre of the garden, halfway between the tomb and the </span><strong>gateway</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , there’s <span class="explainq15 explain">a raised pond</span> which provides a </span><strong>reflection</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Taj Mahal. It’s a magnificent sight. On either side of the tomb there are buildings made of red </span><strong>sandstone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . The one to the west – to the left on our plan –</span> is <span class="explainq16 explain">a mosque</span>. It<span style="font-weight: 400;"> faces towards Mecca and is used for prayer. On the east side of the Teg is a building known as the Rest House. It’s like the twin of the mosque, but because it faces away from Mecca, it was never used for </span><strong>prayer</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have asked what the Rest House was for. Was it a place for </span><strong>pilgrims</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay? Was it a meeting hall of some kind? Perhaps the most likely answer to this question is that its </span><strong>purpose</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is purely </span><strong>aesthetic</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to act as a visual balance for the </span><strong>mosque</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to <span class="explainq17 explain">preserve the symmetry of the design</span> of the whole complex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s have a look at some of the engineering </span><strong>features</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the garden. For one thing, they require a constant supply of running water. When it was built, water was drawn from the <span class="explainq18 explain">river </span></span><strong>manually</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , using an </span><strong>elaborate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rope and bucket system, pulled by a team of bullocks. The water was then brought through a broad water </span><strong>channel</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and held in a number of <span class="explainq19 explain">supply tanks</span>. These tanks were at varying heights off the ground and were </span><strong>ingeniously</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to store the very large amounts of water required. Using an elaborate system of underground pipes, the water was then </span><strong>distributed</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the supply tanks to each of the </span><span class="explainq20 explain"><strong>fountains</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To ensure that the water </span><strong>pressure</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the same throughout the garden, there was a </span><strong>copper</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pot under each fountain connected to the water supply. It was undoubtedly a brilliant system.</span></p>
