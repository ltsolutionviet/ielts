<p><em>You will hear part of a lecture about writing for radio.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lecturer We’re going to move on today to look at some of the key principles of writing for radio.</p>

<p>Of course the main thing that you have to remember is that a radio script is not written to be read, but to be spoken and heard. Now putting this into practice is more difficult than it seems because writing as we speak involves abandoning many of the normal ‘<span class="explainq31 explain">rules</span>’ of writing that have been taught to us from an early age. This is because we need to concentrate on how the piece sounds. Written words convey information, but they don’t convey the full meaning of what you want to say... they don’t tell you what to emphasise, what <span class="explainq32 explain">speed</span> something should be read at, or where the pauses should come, so these have to&nbsp;be indicated in a script.</p>

<p>Whatever is said on radio - whether it’s a link to a magazine programme, a film review, or even a voice piece in the news - needs to sound as if it is coming from the mind of the speaker - almost like part of a <span class="explainq33 explain">conversation</span> - rather than something that is being read.</p>

<p>Before you begin to write, it’s a good idea to know who you’re talking to, to visualise a typical member of the radio station’s audience. If you’re writing a film review for a local audience, for example, think about how you would tell your <span class="explainq34 explain">grandmother</span> about the film, or if you’re reviewing a pop concert, think about how you would tell your friend about the band.</p>

<p>The words have much more impact if each person feels they are being spoken to directly. So your tone needs to be informal - rather than using impersonal words like ‘listeners’ or ‘the audience’, you can make it more informal... include them in what you’re saying by referring to<span class="explainq35 explain"> ‘us’ and ‘we’</span>.</p>

<p>Once you know who you’re talking to, the next thing is to work out what you’re going to say. Don’t forget that the person listening to you has no opportunity to ask questions, and in the same way, you can’t <span class="explainq36 explain">repeat</span> what you’ve just said. For these reasons it’s important that your script is logical and progresses smoothly.</p>

<p>Too many facts too close together will cause confusion, so <span class="explainq37 explain">space</span> them out evenly. The best scripts allow listeners to visualise what you’re describing. For example, instead of giving the physical dimensions of a field, describe it as being the size of, say, a <span class="explainq38 explain">football pitch</span>: if you’re talking about a tall building, relate it to - perhaps - a ten-storey block of flats.</p>

<p>Now, all scripts need something that will grab the attention of the listener. You need something that will make them say, ‘Hey, I want to stop and listen to this.’ So the <span class="explainq39 explain">first sentence</span> has to do this for you ... it needs to be intriguing, interesting - and then it needs to be backed up by a second sentence that explains what you’re talking about. The last sentence should also give your listeners food for thought and can be in the form of a question, or a statement that sums up the item.</p>

<p>After you’ve finished your script you need to polish it up and the most effective method of doing this is by <span class="explainq40 explain">reading it aloud</span>. This also helps you to avoid tongue twisters or words that you might find awkward to pronounce.</p>
