<div id="set-container-2" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 2</h1><p class="text-align-justify">Good morning, everybody and welcome to Mount Rushmore! To start your visit I’m just going to give you a brief account of the history of the memorial before&nbsp;letting you roam about on your own. I won’t keep you long. OK?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mount Rushmore is South Dakota’s top tourist attraction and features the heads of four United States Presidents - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,&nbsp;Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Each head is 18 metres tall, which is&nbsp;taller than the heights of eleven people combined! The sculptor initially wanted&nbsp;to depict the presidents from head to waist, but due to a lack of funding the construction had to stop before this vision could be realised. In total it cost the government $<span class="explainq11 explain">1 million</span> to sculpt the heads at Mount Rushmore.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Before the construction of the presidents’ heads, the mountain was just bare rock and forest attracting only a few hikers a year. The new carving at Mount&nbsp;Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of presidential greatness and has&nbsp;appeared in works of fiction and other popular works. The sculpture has also&nbsp;worked perfectly as a way to develop <span class="explainq12 explain">tourism</span>, which was its intended purpose,&nbsp;and now attracts over two million people a year.</p><p class="text-align-justify">The original plan was to carve the Presidents’ faces into the granite pillars known as ‘The Needles’, however the sculptor soon realised that these rocks&nbsp;were too eroded and delicate to support such a large sculpture. Instead he&nbsp;chose to locate the carving at Mount Rushmore due to its grand appearance and&nbsp;brightly lit rock faces that experience maximum exposure to sunlight throughout&nbsp;the day as a result of the <span class="explainq13 explain">south-east</span> orientation. Upon seeing Mount Rushmore,&nbsp;the sculptor declared ‘America will march along that skyline.’</p><p class="text-align-justify">The name of Mount Rushmore also has an interesting history. The location was originally known as the Six Grandfathers, however during an expedition in 1885&nbsp;the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore, a prominent New York&nbsp;<span class="explainq14 explain">lawyer </span>who joked that his annual treks to the mountain had earned him the right&nbsp;to have it named after him. Forty years after the mountain was renamed, Charles&nbsp;E. Rushmore donated $5,000 towards the sculpting of the president’s heads -the largest single contribution. In 1927 the construction work started and <span class="explainq15 explain">seven&nbsp;</span>years later was complete with no fatalities.</p><p class="text-align-justify">So that’s the history for you. If you’d like any more information, please feel free to ask me questions, or you can soak up the information from our fantastic guide&nbsp;book.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Now I’m going to give you a plan of the site and I’d just like to point out where everything is so that you can explore everything for yourself. We’re currently&nbsp;standing at the entrance, which is marked with the arrow on the map. <span class="explainq16 explain">If you&nbsp;follow the trail up to our left, you will find the information centre.</span> There’s a&nbsp;great photo booth there where you can have your photograph taken with Mount Rushmore in the background for a fee of only $10 - what a great souvenir!<span class="explainq17 explain"> In front of us is the refreshment centre where you can help yourselves to coffee,&nbsp;locally grown tea and a delicious selection of cold drinks and biscuits</span>. Be sure&nbsp;to stay hydrated as it can get really hot up here! <span class="explainq18 explain">To our right not far up the trail&nbsp;is the gift shop</span>. Here we sell copies of the guide book and it’s also the perfect&nbsp;place to pick up some small souvenirs for yourself, your family and friends.&nbsp;<span class="explainq19 explain">Now further up the trail behind the gift shop is a big stone building with a&nbsp;workshop</span>. This is where all of our souvenirs are made by hand, which you can&nbsp;purchase in the gift shop like I said before. Some are even carved from pieces&nbsp;of rock taken from Mount Rushmore itself! <span class="explainq20 explain">If you carry on walking up the trail&nbsp;past the workshop you’ll find our state of the art visitor centre where you can&nbsp;find maps of the walking trails here at Mount Rushmore. </span>Now for the real treat!&nbsp;After you have walked past the visitor centre, you can follow the trail up to the&nbsp;left, which will take you to our wooden shelter. From here you will have the&nbsp;best view of Mount Rushmore that there is - an experience not be forgotten!</p><p class="text-align-justify">Right, if anyone wants a guided tour then I’m starting at the information centre. If you’d like to follow me, this way please.</p></div></div>
