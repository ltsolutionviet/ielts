<div id="set-container-3" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 3</h1><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: Excuse me, Dr Twain. May I speak with you for a minute?</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, please come in.</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: I’m Charlotte York. I’m considering taking your course in Tourism.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Well, Charlotte, how can I help you?</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: I have been considering studying Tourism, however, it is such an important decision that I would like to seek some&nbsp;advice about it first. Would you mind answering some of my&nbsp;questions?</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely, fire away!</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: Well I have been discussing courses with my parents and they are concerned that I will not be able to get a well-paid job with&nbsp;a degree in Tourism. The reason that I want to study the course&nbsp;is that I have a great interest in the subject and I think I would&nbsp;really enjoy it.<span class="explainq21 explain"> I believe the only way that I will enjoy my life&nbsp;is if I enjoy my career. Happiness is far more important than&nbsp;money</span>, don’t you think?</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. I would much rather be happy and poor rather than rich and miserable. Money cannot buy you happiness.</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: I’m glad you agree.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You needn’t worry about money, Charlotte. <span class="explainq22 explain">A large part of the Tourism course is dedicated to teaching students how to manage finances, a skill that you can apply to your everyday&nbsp;life as well.</span> I would also recommend that you take a sideline&nbsp;course in time management, as this can be incredibly useful&nbsp;in efficiently planning your workload. Efficiency is the key to&nbsp;success!</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: I’ll remember that.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have found that some students have natural talents that really help them to succeed in the course. Communication skills, for example, can be very beneficial. Do you have any&nbsp;strengths?</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: Maths was always my favourite subject at school so I really enjoy solving mathematical problems, however I find statistics&nbsp;quite difficult. <span class="explainq23 explain">I have always been very capable and selfsufficient. I have a lot of confidence in my abilities and will&nbsp;take the initiative in situations without needing to depend on&nbsp;anyone else for their help.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s a really great quality to have and will be particularly useful if you choose to study Tourism.</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: That’s great.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would recommend that you spend some of your time researching the course. A lot of people who are uneducated on the subject claim that Tourism is a shrinking industry and&nbsp;that it will become irrelevant in the future. If you study the&nbsp;published research however, you will see that the truth is quite&nbsp;the opposite. <span class="explainq24 explain">The industry has, in fact, grown significantly as&nbsp;people have developed an ever-increasing interest in culture&nbsp;and travel.</span> Have you compared the university course with a&nbsp;polytechnic?</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: Yes, I have. I was interested in studying the course in modules. However, the university doesn’t offer that option.<span class="explainq25 explain"> I don’t have enough funds to be able to attend an expensive university, so&nbsp;I was relieved to see that the course is quite affordable.</span> I also&nbsp;considered attending a summer school instead of university&nbsp;to save money and so that I could work during the rest of the&nbsp;year, but I really wanted the university experience.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that university would suit you well.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the courses? Are you interested in any of the</p><p class="text-align-justify">other subjects on offer?</p><p class="text-align-justify">MELANI E: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at a few. I was interested in Travel and Business as it sounds similar to Tourism.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is really worth learning, <span class="explainq26 explain">however, be aware that it is difficult and will demand a lot of your time.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">MELANIE: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, that’s good to know.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might find that Japanese is an interesting course and it will teach you valuable skills in speaking the language. <span class="explainq27 explain">Personally, it’s not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">MELANIE: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, Japanese, got that.. .What about Medical Care?</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if you have time, the course will teach you a lot about curing diseases and illnesses, or dealing with injuries outside, although it’s not essential.</p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: So, OK, <span class="explainq28 explain">if it’s useful,</span> I’ll take it.</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="explainq29 explain">&nbsp;If you enjoy using technology and are worried about fulfilling the entry requirements, computing is very relaxed about the skills that applicants must possess.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: I’m terrible with computers so I’m not sure that I would enjoy that course. How about Public Relations?</p><p class="text-align-justify">DR TWAIN: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I would recommend that course. <span class="explainq30 explain">It would be related to entering the Tourism industry as it will educate you on how to approach clients and develop associations with them.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">CHARLOTTE: That’s great! Thank you so much for your help!</p></div></div>
