I heard you passed your driving test! Congratulations!</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Olivia! I passed just last week. It feels great to be independent and driving on my own!</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to take driving lessons, but I haven’t been able to find a driving school that will give lessons during the <span class="explainqe explain">weekends</span> so that I don’t have to miss any classes at college.</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving school that I used was brilliant and really flexible with their teaching hours. It’s really close to school. The address is <span class="explainq1 explain">67 King’s</span> Road - that’s 67-KING-apostrophe-S Road.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that’s perfect! I don’t like the idea of driving around busy streets. Did your teacher make you drive in urban areas or did he mainly teach you on roads in the countryside?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teacher said that I had to learn on both in order to become a good and experienced driver. We would start in the city centre and then drive <span class="explainq2 explain">north </span>above the city.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sounds like a good teacher. Would you mind giving me his contact details so I can ask him for lessons?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course! My mother’s friend Daniel Smith referred me to him. His name is Allen Sutcliffe.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you spell the surname please?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">S-U-T-C-L-I-double F-E.</span></p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for helping me out, I’ll give him a call tomorrow. I don’t know if I should learn in a manual or automatic car. How do I decide?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn’t sure which type of car to learn in either. In the end I chose to learn in a manual car because once you’ve learnt how to drive manually you can drive automatic as well. Most cars on the road&nbsp;are <span class="explainq4 explain">automatic </span>nowadays.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I think I’ll learn with a manual car too then. Hopefully the teacher will be able to give me lessons in the evenings after school!</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be much better if you take the lessons during the <span class="explainq5 explain">day</span>. It will be far easier for you to learn when there is enough daylight to clearly see everything going on around you. But you need to be an experienced driver to drive safely at night.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How frustrating! I was hoping I wouldn’t have to take lessons during the weekends! You’re right though, safety comes first!</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of safety, you should wait until summer to start learning! It’s really difficult and dangerous to drive in the wind and rain as a learner so you should definitely wait until the <span class="explainq6 explain">weather </span>is sunny and&nbsp;dry.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, that’s perfect, actually! It will give me some time to save up some money to pay for the lessons.</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about it! I had to work for months before I had enough money saved up! It was worth all the work when I finally got my driving <span class="explainq7 explain">license </span>though!</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is so expensive! How much did it cost you in the end?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, each half hour lesson cost $30 and then the final test cost<span class="explainq8 explain"> $50.</span> In total it cost me about $300.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gosh, it’s pretty expensive! How did you find the test? Was it really difficult?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it wasn’t too bad, and the man was really calm and friendly. I knew that I would have to perform two parking manoeuvres during the test, so I practised them a lot beforehand and that really helped!&nbsp;The test used to last 40 minutes, but it changed a bit. For the first&nbsp;20 minutes of the test he gave me directions and I had to just drive&nbsp;around and then the last 10 minutes was for demonstrating the&nbsp;manoeuvres, so the test is <span class="explainq9 explain">30 </span>minutes in total.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, great, I’ll remember that! Do you have any more advice?</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really good to practise driving a lot outside of driving lessons as well. Whenever my parents were running errands on the weekends I would offer to drive them. My driving teacher also told&nbsp;me to buy a notebook to write down everything that I’ve learnt in&nbsp;it like a <span class="explainq10 explain">diary</span>.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha, that sounds boring, but I’ll do it if it helps.</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it really useful! Before my test I read through everything I had written down and it reminded me of a lot of things that I had forgotten about! It’s really helpful for the theory test as well because there’s so much information to remember for it.</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s great, Zach! Thanks for your help!</p><p>ZACH: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, see you at school!</p><p>OLIVIA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bye!</p></div></div>
