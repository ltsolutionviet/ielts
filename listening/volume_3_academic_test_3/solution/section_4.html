<div id="set-container-4" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 4</h1><p class="text-align-justify">Welcome class to your very first lecture in this series on Business in the Modern World conducted by myself, Dr Toby Bennett. Today we will be looking into&nbsp;the practice of company outsourcing, using TCP Technologies as a case study.&nbsp;Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar with this practice, I will give you a&nbsp;summative definition: company outsourcing involves the contracting of various&nbsp;business activities by one company to another. This practice will sometimes&nbsp;occur from a western company to a party based in a third world country, the&nbsp;rationale being to make significant financial savings on lower international&nbsp;labour rates and to potentially increase quality.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Now, our case study for today is TCP Technologies - a party located in India that receives outsourced tasks from western companies. The manager of TCP&nbsp;Technologies is a man called Manjeet Khanna who has personally developed a&nbsp;series of aims and philosophies by which the company is expected to operate.&nbsp;He claims that the most important of these philosophies is to create a workplace&nbsp;where each individual member has the opportunity to contribute their opinion&nbsp;to the operations of the company. That is to say that he found it important to&nbsp;develop a <span class="explainq31 explain">democratic </span>environment.</p><p class="text-align-justify">As a means of ensuring quality from every individual at TCP Technologies, a grading system has been developed that encourages an ethos of hard work and&nbsp;recognises accomplishment. This grading of individuals is based upon a series&nbsp;of factors such as turnover, hours worked and efficiency. Every month Khanna&nbsp;publishes the grades on an <span class="explainq32 explain">internal website</span> where staff can access not only their&nbsp;own grades, but also compare it to others. A spirit of playful competitiveness&nbsp;has developed through this method, which has resulted in increased efficiency&nbsp;and turnover across the company.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Khanna also saw it as essential to develop a culturally diverse group of employees as a means of presenting a multi-faceted image that would appeal to&nbsp;a host of potential employees from across the globe. This cultural openness has&nbsp;not only increased the quantity of incoming contracted opportunities by 7%, but&nbsp;has also benefitted the company itself significantly. A level of <span class="explainq33 explain">transparency </span>now&nbsp;exists that had not before been apparent. According to questionnaires carried out&nbsp;recently, these newly introduced measures have significantly increased the rate&nbsp;of staff satisfaction, which has subsequently led to an increase of 32% in the&nbsp;<span class="explainq34 explain">company’s income.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">These figures are truly admirable and serve as a testament to the measures that Khanna has introduced to the workplace at TCP Technologies. In a&nbsp;recent interview published by the Economist, he declared, ‘The figures speak&nbsp;for themselves - my system works!’ When asked if he had any advice for&nbsp;companies on methods they could employ to streamline workflow and increase&nbsp;turnover, he replied, “It’s simple, really. A company must see itself not as one&nbsp;entity comprised of nameless components, but instead as a living organism&nbsp;composed of cells, each one essential to the functioning of the whole. I suggest&nbsp;that the motto by which your management operates will be ‘<span class="explainq35 explain">employee first’</span>.”</p><p class="text-align-justify">Many benefits have been reaped from the aforementioned changes in management style, such as a significant decrease in staff turnover. This&nbsp;improvement alone has solved many problems that had before stunted the&nbsp;growth of the company. A lot of these improvements came from the realisation&nbsp;that the <span class="explainq36 explain">solution </span>does not have to be produced internally, but can come from any&nbsp;other company. The grading system also immeasurably enhanced the dynamics&nbsp;of the company. The fact that this measuring system is solely produced for&nbsp;staff members and inaccessible by management means that it cannot be used&nbsp;as a judging criterion for <span class="explainq37 explain">promotion</span>. It has proven itself a relaxed and informal&nbsp;means of stimulating workflow.</p><p class="text-align-justify">When asked about specific features of his managing style, Khanna mentioned that it is important for him to respond personally to any complaints filed by staff&nbsp;members. Having found the existing complaints process slow and ineffective,&nbsp;he introduced a new online system that created a direct line of communication&nbsp;between Khanna and all employees of the company. The complaint form, dubbed by Khanna as a <span class="explainq38 explain">ticket</span>, eradicates the middleman, is easily accessible to all employees online and has an interface that can be instinctively navigated.&nbsp;Any staff-related complaint, such as those relating to air conditioning and food&nbsp;quality, can be submitted directly to Khanna via this online system. Entitlement&nbsp;to <span class="explainq39 explain">vacation </span>is also a popular issue discussed through this forum. The main&nbsp;benefit of using this system is that staff must include their personal details on&nbsp;the ticket before they are able to submit it. In the past, anonymous complaints&nbsp;had been at the root of much confusion and caused many wasted work hours, so&nbsp;the new system has put a <span class="explainq40 explain">ban </span>on this form of complaint.</p><p class="text-align-justify">That wraps up the lecture for today.
