<div class="passage-content"> <h1>SECTION 1</h1>

<p>Megan and Ken are deciding how they will spend the evening. Look at section 1 of your listening test. You have some time to look at Questions 1 to 7 now. You will see that there is an example which has been done for you. The conversation relating to this will be played first.</p>

<p><em>Telephone rings</em></p>

<p>Megan: Hello. Megan speaking.</p>

<p>Ken: Hello Megan.</p>

<p>Megan: Hello Ken. I’m glad you called. Thomas asked me to give you his telephone number.</p>

<p>Ken: Is that his office number or his home number?</p>

<p>Megan: I can give you both. His new home number is <span class="explainqe explain">9452 3456.</span> Would you like his office number?</p>

<p>Ken: I think I have it. Does 9731 4322 sound right?</p>

<p>Megan: That’s it. But the home number is 9452 3456. He moved in last week.</p>

<p>Ken: Good. I’ve got that. Now, what would you like to do?</p>

<p>Narrator: Thomas’s home telephone number is 9452 3456 so letter C has been circled. Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the questions a second time. First, you have another chance to look at questions 1 to 7. Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 7.</p>

You should answer the recording as you listen because you will not hear the questions a second time. First, you have another chance to look at questions 1 to 7. Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 7.</p>

<p>Ken: Good. I’ve got that. Now, what would you like to do?</p>

<p>Megan: Well, I’d like to go dancing, but Jane’s hurt her ankle so she’d rather not.</p>

<p>Ken: That’s a pity. I guess it means she doesn’t want to play tennis, either.</p>

<p>Megan: That’s right. She says it’s okay to <span class="explainq1 explain">go bowling</span> if we don’t expect her to do well.</p>

<p>Ken: Okay, let’s do it! I guess we can go dancing another time.</p>

<p>Megan: Well, I booked us some time at the bowling alley of Entertainment City. Do you know it?</p>

<p>Ken: Is it on Smith Street, down near the university?</p>

<p>Megan: That’s right. <span class="explainq2 explain">It’s on the comer of Smith Street and Bridge Road</span>.</p>

<p>Ken: What time did you book for?</p>

<p>Megan: The first booking I could get was 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>Ken: Okay. It’s 7 now. What do you want to do first?</p>

<p>Megan: Well, I think we should leave now. We can meet at the bowling alley.</p>

<p>Ken: I can’t be that quick. I have to call Thomas, to start with, and I need to get changed.</p>

<p>Megan: Okay. I think I’ll leave in ten minutes and meet you in there.</p>

<p>Ken: That makes sense. I’ll take my car, so I’ll be quite quick. <span class="explainq3 explain">I’ll be out of here in half an hour</span>.</p>

<p>Megan: Okay. You’re so lucky to have a car! You can get around so easily.</p>

<p>Ken: Well, yes and no. I often spend ages driving around trying to find a park. The traffic can be very bad.</p>

<p>Megan: Well, that won’t be a problem for me, because <span class="explainq4 explain">I’ll take the bus</span>. It goes right past my door, and I’ll have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Ken: Sounds good. Who else is coming?</p>

<p>Megan: I think <span class="explainq5 explain">nearly everyone from the afternoon class will be there</span>.</p>

<p>Ken: Which class? The big maths class, or the afternoon tutorial?</p>

<p>Megan: The maths class. What’s more, we get a concession for large numbers!</p>

<p>Ken: That’s good. I’m trying to keep my expenses down this month.</p>

<p>Megan: So am I. I expect tonight ‘ll cost about $20. Ken: You must be good with money. I expect it to come to… um … <span class="explainq6 explain">nearly $40</span>! So how are you going to manage that?</p>

<p>Megan: Well, the bus is cheap, and if I come home early I won’t have time to spend too much! In any case, I have to be up early tomorrow morning, so I’d really better<span class="explainq7 explain"> try to get home by about 11</span>.</p>

<p>Ken: That reminds me. I have to phone the taxi company for my mother. Goodbye, Megan. I’ll see you later.</p>

<p>Megan: Goodbye, Ken.</p>

<p><em>Sound of phone hanging up.</em></p>

<p>Narrator: Ken calls the taxi company. Listen and be ready to answer questions S and 9. Now listen to the telephone call and be ready to answer questions 8 and 9.</p>

<p><em>Sound of somebody dialling, plume ringing</em></p>
