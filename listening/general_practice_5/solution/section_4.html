<div class="passage-content"> <h1>SECTION 4</h1>

<p>Speaker Postgraduates are about as easy to define as catching steam in a bucket Courses can be vocational, for training, as research, as a preparation for research, or a combination of these. Also you can choose between full-time and part-time. Increasingly, the approach to postgraduate study is becoming modular. <span class="explainq32 explain">The vast majority of postgraduates are doing short, taught courses, many of which provide specific vocational training</span>. Indeed, there has been a 400% increase in postgraduate numbers in Britain over the past 20 years. Current figures stand at just under 400,000.</p>

<p>People undertake postgraduate study for many reasons. These may be academic (intellectual challenge, development of knowledge), vocational (training for a specific career goal) or only vague (drifting into further study). <span class="explainq33 explain">It is essential that you determine the reasons you want to become a postgraduate</span>. If you have clear goals and reasons for studying, this will enhance your learning experience and help you to remain focused and motivated throughout your course.</p>

<p>Where you study should be based on much more than the course you want to do. For some courses you are likely to be there for several years, and <span class="explainq34 explain">it is important that you are happy living there</span>. Check also what type of accommodation is available and whether the institution provides any housing specifically for postgraduates.</p>

<p>Choosing an institution and department is a difficult process. To determine quality, do not rely on the reputation of an institution, but find out what ratings are from the most recent assessment exercises. Find out about the staff, their reputation, competence, enthusiasm and friendliness. Visit the department if possible and talk to existing postgraduates about their experience, satisfaction, comments and complaints. <span class="explainq35 explain">Be very careful to check how they feel about their supervisors</span>.</p>

<p>Also, check what facilities are available, both at an institutional level (for example libraries, laboratory and computing facilities) and in the department (for example study room, desk, photocopying, secretarial support etc.). Everyone will have their own priorities here:<span class="explainq36 explain"> I am always anxious to check the computer support available</span>, and regard it as slightly more important than library access. Your working environment and the support available to you plays an essential part in making your work as a postgraduate a positive experience.</p>

<p>Life as a postgraduate can be very different to your other experiences of education. Things that can distinguish your experience are the level of study» independence of working, intensity of the course, the demands on your time, and often the fact that you are older than the majority of the students.</p>

<p>These factors can contribute to making you feel isolated. However, there are several ways you can make sure that this is either short-lived or does not happen at all.</p>

<p>Many student unions have <span class="explainq37 explain">postgraduate societies that organise social events</span> and may also provide representation for postgraduates to both the student union and the institution. Departments can also help to create a sense of identity and community, and often have discussion groups available. Don’t be afraid to talk to staff about any difficulties you might be having. Of course universities provide counselling services but we have found that the best advice comes from talking to other postgraduates who may have faced similar difficulties.</p>

<p>Narrator: Look at questions 38 to 40. Write no more than three words or numbers for each answer. Speaker: Financial planning is essential, since the government excludes postgraduates from student loans, and it can be difficult to maintain your student status with banks. This has implications for free banking and overdraft facilities. Do not underestimate your living costs, including food, accommodation and travel, and<span class="explainq38 explain"> be careful not to budget for everything except a social life</span>.</p>

<p>Funding a course is one of the most challenging things people face when considering postgraduate study. Most postgraduate students are self-financing. They pay (often very large) fees to the institution and receive no maintenance income to support their study. Make sure you know exactly what your costs will be – institutions often <span class="explainq39 explain">hide extra fees</span> like laboratory costs behind tire headline fee rate advertised.</p>

<p>Funding can come from various sources. Research councils, charities, trust funds, institutional scholarships, local education authorities and professional bodies and organisations all offer</p>

<p>various levels of funding. As I said before, <span class="explainq40 explain">the government</span> excludes postgraduates from student loans, so it is essential you look to other sources. Career development loans are available from high street banks. The best advice on funding is to be proactive, persistent and patient.</p>

<p>The postgraduate community in Britain is multinational, has a wide range of experience of life and work and an exciting mix of goals, both career and academic. Being a postgraduate student should be a productive and fulfilling thing to do, and you will become part of a diverse and motivated social group.</p>
