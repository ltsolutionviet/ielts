<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION&nbsp;4</strong></h1>

<p>OK and welcome back. During the short break we just took, several of you approached me with questions. So, before going on with the orientation talk, I’d like to address those queries. As I’ve found, if one person asks a question, probably a dozen others are wondering about the same thing!</p>

<p>The first question is whether Wassamatta U. employs <span class="explainq31 explain">modules technology</span> as an instruction method. The answer is yes, we do. At least that’s what the university catalogue says. If some of you don’t under­stand what “modules technology” is, don’t worry. I googled the word but couldn’t find it. Apparently, though, it’s a method of broadband, wireless access. At least that’s what an American company’s website told me. But again, don’t worry. If you need to know something more, your professor can tell you.</p>

<p>Another question someone asked me was what tomorrow’s work­shop on “Research Methods and Skills” was about. Well, research skills include any method you can imagine for finding and presenting any information you need. That’s not just schoolwork, either. Writing English - the native language for most of you - and <span class="explainq32 explain">finding a job</span> are&nbsp;also research skills. And, yes, those will be addressed in tomorrow’s workshop.</p>

<p>As you know, Wassamatta U. is one of this country's premier uni­versities for the study of “the dismal science", economics. Some of you, it seems, want to get a jump on their classmates. During the break, half a dozen of you came up and asked me where to find eco­nomics tomes. I know it’s odd, but this school’s library holdings are divided up between two libraries. Economics books are in the <span class="explainq33 explain">old&nbsp;library</span>. If you look out of the window behind me, you can see it. It’s the red brick building.</p>

<p>Oh, before I forget, you economics types also need a lot of maths, am I right? Well, those Maths books are neither in the old library nor in the new one. They can be found in the <span class="explainq34 explain">Maths Department</span> Building.&nbsp;<br>
Why am I telling you this? Doesn’t “the Invisible Hand” guide econo­mists? Maybe it’s good you asked: in 2008, that Hand shoved most of the world economy off a cliff, didn’t it?</p>

<p>Now I realise that most of you couldn’t bring a computer printer or a photocopier from home. So I’m sure you’re already wondering where you can copy things like term papers, Internet articles, and things like that. I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there are a number of places you can make copies. These include both libraries and the Student Union Building.</p>

<p>Now the bad news. I am sorry to say, most classroom buildings and academic departments do not have copiers students can use. <span class="explainq35 explain">So most&nbsp;of the large buildings you see around campus do not have copiers for students.</span> The copiers there are reserved for professors and office staff. Oh, yes! I nearly forget to tell you. <span class="explainq36 explain">If you need to have printing done, all the copiers available to students are laser printers.</span> Plus, for&nbsp;your convenience, you can pay using prepaid cards. You can get those in the Student Union Building.</p>

<p>That just covers the questions put to me. If you have more, please see me during the next break at 2:15. Right now, though, I’d like to start to give you a rundown on the various facilities here on campus. That way, you won’t get lost so easily in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>I have been told that this year’s incoming class features a large num­ber of married students and parents. So, you must be wondering where to put the baby while you’re in class. OK, right now, we are in the Student Union Building, right? Remember the big doors in front where you all came in? <span class="explainq37 explain">If you go out of the building, you can see&nbsp;the Nursery is just on the other side of this building</span>. It’s only about twenty metres away! Convenient, eh?</p>

<p>Next, we’re all from different places around the country. Some of you are from other countries. That means we’re pretty likely to get sick during the first months of school as we expose each other to many new viruses. So, where’s the doctor? Of course, <span class="explainq38 explain">you need to find the&nbsp;Medical Services Centre which is on the right as you leave the build­ing</span>. Remember, that’s the second building on the right.</p>

<p>And if you look out of that window, <span class="explainq39 explain">you can see a lot of antennae and&nbsp;satellite dishes on the roof. So that's what we call the Media Centre.</span></p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I think it’s confusing, too. The Media Centre is next to the Medical Centre. The chairwoman of the Journalism School on the first floor doesn’t like it when people who wander in there mistake her for a nurse!</p>

<p>Chances are you’ll have at least one Maths class while you’re here.</p>

<p>That red building there just outside to the left is the Maths Depart­ment Building. I know, it looks about as old as the subject as Maths, but I assure you that the inside is equipped with state-of-the-art classroom equipment including interactive chalkboards and surround sound in every room.</p>

<p>Oh, can you see the back building there? <span class="explainq40 explain">Yes, behind the Media&nbsp;Centre. Quite new, isn't it? That’s the new library, just decorated.</span></p>

<p>They’re back-to-back, you might say. If you look just to the left of it at the lower, older-looking building, you’ll find the old library. It’s nice and quiet - perfect for those marathon study sessions during exam week. Since the weather is so nice, why don't we stop looking at our maps but go for a walk around the campus?</p>
