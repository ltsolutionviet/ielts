<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION 1</strong></h1>

<p>WOMAN: Hello, how may I help you?</p>

<p>MAN: Well, I’ve been seeing these yellow boxes in front of a lot of houses in my neighbourhood. I just wondered what they were for. I noticed your phone number on all of them, so I called. Could you tell me about your business?</p>

<p>WOMAN: We do do <span class="explainqe explain">recycling</span>, but we’re not a business. Gaea’s Guard­ians is a non-profit group. We encourage recycling as a way of protecting the environment.</p>

<p>MAN: I don’t know. I mean it is a good idea. But I really don’t read the newspaper every day or anything.</p>

<p>WOMAN: And we don’t come collect newspaper every day! In fact, we only do pickups <span class="explainq1 explain">every other week</span>.</p>

<p>MAN: Oh, well then maybe I could help. I mean in my neighbour­hood, there’s too much rubbish lying around everywhere. I’d like to help out, I guess.</p>

<p>WOMAN: That’s great, sir. You’re doing the right thing. OK, I need to get your contact information. What is your name, please?</p>

<p>MAN: <span class="explainq2 explain">Peter Wisrough</span>..</p>

<p>WOMAN: Peter... how do you spell your last name? W-I-S-R-O-W?</p>

<p>MAN: No, actually it’s W-I-S-R-O-U-G-H.</p>

<p>WOMAN: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m a terrible speller.</p>

<p>MAN: You’re a good speller. It’s just that my family are terrible&nbsp;pronouncers!</p>

<p>WOMAN: You’re quite a card, Peter! OK, now what’s your address?</p>

<p>MAN: No. <span class="explainq3 explain">168 Bridge Road</span>. That’s here in London. How about if I have any questions?</p>

<p>WOMAN: MAN: I'm sending you a copy of our booklet, too. The booklet has our phone number and our e-mail address, <span class="explainq4 explain">helpline@blackcat.com,</span> that’s H-E-L-P-L-I-N-E at B-L-A-C-K-C-A-T dot com.</p>

<p>But I nearly forgot to ask, what’s your postcode?</p>

<p><span class="explainq5 explain">BS97PU</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PS97BU?</p>

<p>No. That’s B as in “boy"-S-9-7-P as in “Peter”-U.</p>

<p>So, I’m guessing those <span class="explainq6 explain">yellow</span> boxes I saw are for recycled&nbsp;newspapers?</p>

<p>Yes, that is correct, and it’s free of charge.</p>

<p>Wow, that’s good news! Do you recycle anything besides newspaper?</p>

<p>Oh yes, we recycle most everything. Glass, plastic, paper...</p>

<p>Oh, so I can put like glass and plastic bottles in the box?</p>

<p>Sorry again. Things like that you have to bring to our collec­tion centre.</p>

<p>And where is that?</p>

<p>Our main centre isn’t that far from you. It’s actually right on the East Side of <span class="explainq7 explain">Central Park</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That new blue building?</p>

<p>That’s the one!</p>

<p>Cool. Hey, what’s with all those different coloured boxes outside that place?</p>

<p>Oh, that’s for the different materials we recycle. The blue is for <span class="explainq8 explain">metal</span>, the green is for glass and plastics, and the yellow&nbsp;of course is for paper.</p>

<p>Hm, okay. I’ll try and manage to keep all that straight.</p>

<p>Oh, no need, they’re each labelled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great. So which one would I put magazines in?</p>

<p>MAN: Actually, they don’t go in any of the bins. Unfortunately, <span class="explainq9 explain">magazines</span> can’t be recycled because of the material they’re&nbsp;made of. It’s such a waste. So would you be interested in volunteering?</p>

<p>Um, I’ll think about it. Could you send me some more info?</p>

<p>Absolutely. Along with the newspaper box, I’ll be sending you our booklet, “<span class="explainq10 explain">Savvy</span>", that is S-A-double V-Y. It tells&nbsp;you about what you can do to protect theenvironment in your daily life. Plus it lists things you can do as a volunteer with our group.</p>

<p>Hey, that’s cool, thanks!</p>

<p>My pleasure. Do you have any other questions or concerns?</p>

<p>Nope, that’s it!</p>
