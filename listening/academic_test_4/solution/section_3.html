<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION&nbsp;3</strong></h1>

<p>FRANK: Hello, are you Dr Lindsey? The Returning Students Advisor?</p>

<p>DR LINDSEY: Yes, that’s right. Are you Frank? Your appointment wasn’t till 2:00, but that's OK. Please come in and have a seat.</p>

<p>FRANK: Thanks, I like to arrive early whenever I have anything to do.</p>

<p>DR LINDSEY: That’s certainly a praiseworthy habit. Let me see, it looks like you’ve taken a long break from school, and <span class="explainq21 explain">I understand you wanted to have a chat about what you should study if and when you return for further classes.</span></p>

<p>FRANK: It’s such a big challenge. I don’t know if I’m crazy for doing this or not!</p>

<p>DR LINDSEY Believe it or not, I know exactly what you mean. Before I began working here at the university, I taught primary school for nearly ten years. It takes a lot of courage to go back to school!</p>

<p>FRANK: I feel more shy and scared than the primary students I teach! In the schools I taught,<span class="explainq22 explain"> I found today’s young­sters are very sure of themselves</span>. In terms of intelli­gence, I have a lot to teach them. And the maturity level of much of my class leaves something to be desired. But in terms of confidence, wow! A lot more confident than I am now, that’s for sure!</p>

<p>DR LINDSEY: Stop fretting. “A brave man is a coward who refuses to run.” Let’s talk about your strong points. You seem an intelligent man. What is it you would like to study?</p>

<p>FRANK You see,<span class="explainq23 explain"> I’ve been teaching children for a few years, but I think I’d be happier teaching adults.</span></p>

<p>DR LINDSEY: I think teaching students in middle school is much more satisfying because they end up being much more grateful for your work. If I may ask, what got you inter­ested in teaching adults?</p>

<p>A lot of things, I guess. I met my future wife back in my first year of college. She always complains that I was more interesting then. She says that now I talk like I’m seven years old! That’s probably from being with chil­dren all day.</p>

<p>Ha ha ha! Again I know just what you mean. My husband used to say the same thing about me when I taught kindergarten. Anything else?</p>

<p>Well, yes.<span class="explainq24 explain"> Fairly often now I run into former students&nbsp;and we talk</span>. Some of them are getting close to being grown up. I guess I think more and more about how people develop over time. So, I'm interested in the re­sults of education, you know, the final stages.</p>

<p>I see. Well, coming back to the university can be both difficult and very rewarding. There are some problems unique to returning students, you know, older stu­dents like yourself. What do you think is your greatest weakness?</p>

<p>Well, I actually think my confidence is getting better.</p>

<p>I’m definitely overcoming my introversion and starting to be much more comfortable in front of a class. To tell the truth, <span class="explainq25 explain">I’m afraid I’m rather behind the times about&nbsp;many things.</span> It’s more difficult for me to chase after the popular things youngsters are fond of - such as Iphone, Twitter, if you name it!<br>
I think I understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="explainq26 explain">How old are you, 35? People at your age still go back to&nbsp;school for further education. I was a bit the same way.</span></p>

<p>I mean I didn’t study at the university till after I had a family: a husband and one child. My point of view was a lot different from your average eighteen-year-old girl’s, I can tell you!</p>

<p>Gee, that sounds pretty rough. A family and college?</p>

<p>Clearly you weren’t unsuccessful though!</p>

<p>It was, Frank. It truly was. <span class="explainq27 explain">My first term at school was&nbsp;extremely stressful</span>. But excuse me! You’re not here to listen to my life story. We’re talking about your plans.</p>

<p>Is there anything unique I should know about you or your past experience or plans?<br>
I’m afraid not. <span class="explainq28 explain">There is nothing interesting about my&nbsp;career or plans. It’s really not too impressive.</span></p>

<p>Now, I forbid you to talk like that. This is your one life, and if you’re not interested, why bother living it? Don’t be so humble, Frank.</p>

<p>OK, OK. My wife says I’m a wimp.</p>

<p>Let's talk about your dreams a bit. You want to teach adults, you said. What would you like to teach them?</p>

<p>Well, when I first came to college, I really liked Lan­guages and Literature. A lot of people have told me that for practical reasons, it would be more rewarding to choose Business Management as my major, <span class="explainq29 explain">but I made&nbsp;up my mind to study Liberal Arts once I got the idea of going back to school.</span></p>

<p>I must say it’s refreshing to meet someone who knows there’s more to an education than computers and finance. Let’s have a look at the university course catalogue...</p>

<p>Excuse me, Dr Lindsey. Before we do that, could I maybe ask you some questions about changes in uni­versity life? I think I need to discuss that so I know what to expect.</p>

<p>Of course. I’m here to help you. The biggest thing to get used to is the change in technology. Professors pres­ent things on huge screens, many of which are inter­active computerised whiteboards. You can write on them still and use them like a touch screen. They’re really handy! No more sloppy scribbled notes on the projector. Let's see, <span class="explainq30 explain">I doubt you’ll be living in student&nbsp;housing, so I won’t go into all the improvements there.</span></p>

<p>Another major change that you’ll enjoy is the plethora of resources available for students. As a student, you have 24-hour access to the gym, and library privileges that include the use of school computers to scan, copy, and print, and of course the Media Library, which con­tains movies from all genres and most of the movies listed on AFI’s Top 100 Movies of All Time. The dining facilities are also not what they used to be.</p>

<p>They offer choices for all diets, and you can expect a hot meal any time of day.</p>

<p>FRANK:Wow, things really have changed! I’ll be sure to utilise all those great facilities in my time here. Thanks for all your help, Dr Lindsey. I think that’s all the questions I have for now.</p>
