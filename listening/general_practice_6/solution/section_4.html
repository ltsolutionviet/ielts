<p>Broadcaster: Hello. Welcome to the student orientation program. Today’s session is on health issues, and this talk is about headaches, and how to avoid them. It may surprise you to hear that headaches are often caused by <span class="explainq30. explain">hunger</span>! In fact one study suggested that 70% of headaches are related to hunger, which makes it the principal cause.</p>

<p>The advice is simple: eat three meals a day and try to keep to a fairly regular schedule of meals. People associate <span class="explainq31 explain">noise</span> with headaches, and for most of us excessive noise creates the conditions for a headache. Very loud noise is unpleasant, and people usually remove themselves from it. Having said that, younger people tend to tolerate noise better than their elders, so I may be leaving noisy places far earlier than you. Just remember that exposure to too much noise may predispose you to a headache. Of course, we all associate headaches with <span class="explainq32 explain">studying</span>! In fact the headache probably doesn’t come from the studying so much as from being <span class="explainq33 explain">tense</span>. When we study hard, we often hunch over our work. Try raising your shoulders and tensing them – now relax. Can you feel how much more comfortable a relaxed stance is? Another thing – it’s very important to check that you are working in a good light. It will not actually hurt your eyes to work in a bad light, but it will make you <span class="explainq34 explain">tired</span> very quickly and is very likely to give you a headache. What’s more, if you have the book flat on a desk in front of you it will be harder to read, and you will have to hold your head at an odd angle. It is wise to have a bookrest which raises the material you are reading <span class="explainq35 explain">45 degrees</span> to the desk. This will help reduce your chance of a headache. Try to relax before bed so that you will be <span class="explainq36 explain">relaxed</span> when you try to sleep – a soak in a hot bath may be helpful. It’s also important to really sleep when you go to bed: a good mattress is a wise investment for people who want to avoid headaches.</p>

<p>This talk seems to keep coming back to tension. Tension may cause you to <span class="explainq37 explain">chew</span> too forcefully, clench your jaw, or grind your teeth, and this in turn may lead to headaches. It is very easy to say that you shouldn’t grind your teeth, and very hard to stop, particularly if you grind your teeth in your sleep.</p>

<p>Try to avoid situations which will make you tense, particularly just before bed. If you do compulsively grind your teeth in your sleep, ask your dentist about a soft mouthguard.</p>

<p>In general, try to eat regular meals and avoid tense situations. Be sure you get plenty of <span class="explainq38 explain">exercise</span>. Hopefully your headaches will be greatly reduced. One other thing I should point out – avoid <span class="explainq39 explain">smoky</span> rooms and cars. Such places certainly encourage headaches, and the smoke may be doing you quite serious <span class="explainq40 explain">long-term</span> damage.</p>
