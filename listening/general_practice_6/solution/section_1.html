<div class="passage-content"> <h1>SECTION 1</h1>

<p>Listen to the conversation between two students, John and Carol. They have a list of the names of authors whose books have been given to the library. They have to classify the authors as writers of cookery, sports or travel. First you have some time to look at Questions 1 to 8 on the table now.</p>

<p>You will see that there is an example which has been done for you. The conversation relating to this will be played first.</p>

<p>John: This is a great collection of books, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Carol: Very impressive. Who gave them to us?</p>

<p>John: Apparently the donor was a book reviewer. There are a lot of books about sport. Here’s one.&nbsp;<em>My life in cricket.</em></p>

<p>Carol: That’s certainly sports. Who’s the author?</p>

<p>John: Peter Adams.</p>

<p>Carol: He also wrote Journeys through Spain.</p>

<p>John: Did he?</p>

<p>Narrator: Peter Adams writes on both sports and travel, so <span class="explainqe explain">S T</span> is written against his name.</p>

<p>Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 8.</p>

<p>John: This is a great collection of books, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Carol: Very impressive. Who gave them to us?</p>

<p>John: Apparently the donor was a book reviewer.</p>

<p>There are a lot of books about sport. Here’s one.&nbsp;<em>My life in cricket.</em></p>

<p>Carol: That’s certainly sports. Who’s the author?</p>

<p>John: Peter Adams.</p>

<p>Carol: He also wrote Journeys through Spain.</p>

<p>John: Did he?</p>

<p>Carol: Next one is Stephen Bau.</p>

<p>John: He wrote Summer Barbecues, <span class="explainq1 explain">Cooking for Singles</span>, Dinners by Candlelight…</p>

<p>Carol: Anything else?</p>

<p>John: No. Do you have anything by Pam Campbell?</p>

<p>Carol: Wanderings in Greece, My life in Russia, <span class="explainq2 explain">Travels</span> in the Amazon, and Pam Campbell’s guide to a successful trip.</p>

<p>John: Sounds like she got around! My next one is C. Kezik.</p>

<p>Carol: He has a list of books about football. The World Cup. Heroes of the World Cup. Playing with the round ball. Soccer for everyone…</p>

<p>John: That’s enough! He was a one-topic writer. Ari Hussein, however, wrote about <span class="explainq3 explain">cooking and travel</span>! His series of cook books is called Living and cooking in Spain, Living and cooking in China, Living and cooking in Brazil. He’s been everywhere.</p>

<p>Carol: I’ve got a specialist here. Sally Innes on tennis. Here are some of her titles: Improve your serve, Tennis for everyone, Tennis forever!</p>

<p>John: Meg Jorgensen has three books, one in each category: <span class="explainq4 explain">Cooking for health, Sport is good for you! and Travelling in Australia.</span></p>

<p>Carol: A varied talent. Who’s next?</p>

<p>John: Bruno Murray. <span class="explainq5 explain">He wrote children’s books – a whole series called A child’s guide and then the name of the city</span>.</p>

<p>Carol: Oh. You mean like A child’s guide to London?</p>

<p>John: Yes, that’s right He seems to have stayed in Europe. Ruby Lee, however, has just one book. It’s called <span class="explainq6 explain">The emerald isle and it’s all about Ireland</span>. Apparently she went around Ireland on foot.</p>

<p>Carol: Jim Wells wouldn’t like that! <span class="explainq7 explain">His books are all about motor racing</span>. Hmm. Nice photos of old racing cars. Don’t you love the goggles on the driver?</p>

<p>John: They do look strange, don’t they? I think we’re nearly finished. What did Helen Yeung write?</p>

<p>Carol: Summer menus: food for thought. <span class="explainq8 explain">She also did a book of Chinese recipes – Cantonese, I think.</span></p>

<p>John: Okay. That’s dealt with the first box. Let’s stop for a minute.</p>
