<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION 3</strong></h1>

<p>In this section you will hear a discussion between two students who have to describe a lawn sprinkler for part of their general science course.</p>

<p>(A lawn sprinkler is a machine designed to water gardens and lawns). In the first part of the discussion tine students are talking about the different parts of the sprinkler. First look at questions 19 to 23. Note the example that has been done for you.</p>

<p>Now listen to the conversation and label the parts of the sprinkler on the diagram. Choose from the box. There are more words in the box than you will need. Linda: Hello, Scott! I believe you’re going to be my partner for this practical session. Have you got the model set up?</p>

<p>Scott: Yes. Uh. It’s right here. The instructions say we have to describe it first, and label the diagram. I’ve started from where the water enters the machine. Um. The water enters through a hose pipe and then it turns a water wheel. You can see where the wheel is marked by an arrow pointing upwards. It’s called a <span class="explainq19 explain">water wheel</span> because it’s designed so the water will catch against the wheel. This action spins a series of <span class="explainq20 explain">gears</span> … Linda: How are you going to describe the gears? Scott: There are two worm gears, one vertical and one horizontal. The horizontal worm gear drives a circular gear. That gear is connected to a crank which changes the motion. The crank is already labelled.</p>

<p>Do you see the two white arrows?</p>

<p>Linda: I see. Okay, the water has passed across the water wheel. Then what?</p>

<p>Scott: Okay. Umm. Then you could say the water passes through the <span class="explainq21 explain">spray tube</span>.</p>

<p>Linda: Yes, I see.</p>

<p>Scott: And the water is then spread over the lawn through <span class="explainq22 explain">holes</span> at the top of the spray tube.</p>

<p>Linda: How are you going to describe the base?</p>

<p>Scott: How about this: “The sprinkler stands on a <span class="explainq23 explain">base</span> consisting of two metal tubes which join at a hinge at one end and continue into a plastic moulding at the other.”</p>

<p>Linda: That’s certainly starting at the bottom. Do you want to mention that there’s no water in the base? Scott: 1 don’t think that’s necessary. If you look at the diagram it’s easy to see that the only metal tube to contain water is the spray tube. You can actually see the water coming out of it.</p>

<p><em>Narrator: Now listen while Linda and Scott’s instructor, Mark Stewart, talks to them. Answer questions 24 to 29.</em></p>

<p>Mark: Hello Scott, Linda. I’m glad I caught you before class. Did you know’ about the change in the examination schedule?</p>

<p>Scott: Change?</p>

<p>Mark: Yes. The last day of examinations for your group will be <span class="explainq24 explain">December 2nd</span> instead of November 29th.</p>

<p>Scott: Is that definite? We were told they’d be on November 26, and then there was a rumour they’d be on December the 1st.</p>

<p>Mark: The schedule’s gone to the printer. There can be no changes. It’s definitely December 2nd. Scott: That’s a relief.<span class="explainq25 explain"> I’m going to the US</span> on December the 4th.</p>

<p>Mark: Are you one of the exchange students?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. Yeah. I’m really looking forward to studying there. Do you know if their general science courses are anything like ours?</p>

<p>Linda: It’s not very likely.</p>

<p>Mark: Actually, all basic general science courses are fairly <span class="explainq26 explain">similar</span>. You’ll find you’re behind in some things and ahead in others. I wouldn’t worry too much about the course. You’ve been doing well on this one. Linda, <span class="explainq27 explain">have you finished your assignment yet?</span></p>

<p>Linda: I’m nearly there. I should be able to give it to you on Monday.</p>

<p>Mark: That’s good, I can’t let you have another extension.</p>

<p>Linda: I was really grateful for the extra time you gave me. That was a really big assignment.</p>

<p>Mark: Well, I’ll expect it next week. Now, would you like to hear the details of the timetable?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh. Yes, please.</p>

<p>Mark: I’ve just finished putting it on the noticeboard downstairs. Basically, you’ll have four examinations. General mechanics is in the morning of December 1st, physics and maths are on the afternoon of the same day. Communications and English are on the morning of<span class="explainq28 explain"> December 2nd</span>, and Earth Sciences in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Linda: All over in two days!</p>

<p>Mark: Yes. I’ll miss teaching this class. <span class="explainq29 explain">You’re all good at expressing your views, which makes for an interesting class</span>. Some of the other first year classes won’t talk, and they’re rather boring to teach.</p>
