<div class="passage-content"> <h1>SECTION 2</h1>

<p><em>You are going to hear a talk by a student adviser who is inviting new students to a welcoming party. Look at the invitation. Tick if the information is correct or write in the changes. First look at questions 9 to 14.</em></p>

<p><em>As you listen to the first part of the talk, answer questions 9 to 14.</em></p>

<p>Student Adviser Hello. My name is Dave Bums, and I’m here to tell you about the welcoming party we are having for new students. Unfortunately the information on your invitation is inaccurate. We didn’t have enough time to print new invitations, so I’ll have to ask you to make changes.</p>

<p>To start with, this isn’t a welcoming lunch: it’s a dance party. However, the next line is true. The party will be held at Blackwell House. Is everybody comfortable with that? The next line tells you when the party will be: <span class="explainq9 explain">Friday June 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;at 8 pm</span>, but I have good news: the party will end at <span class="explainq10 explain">11 pm</span>. As a result of this later end to the party the bus will go later, too, so it should read <span class="explainq11 explain">“Free transport to the student hostel is available leaving Blackwell House at 11.30</span>”. And of course <span class="explainq12 explain">other students may attend</span>, and <span class="explainq13 explain">all students must have their student ID card with them</span>.</p>

<p>I hope you can come to the welcoming party. It’s a really good way to get to know other students and to learn what it’s like to live in this city and to study here. Just one final change: please let us know by <span class="explainq14 explain">Thursday</span> if you can come.</p>

<p>Narrator: Now listen while Dave Burns gives instructions for students who are going to travel by car to the party. First look at questions 15 to 18. Write no more than three words for each answer.</p>

<p>Student Adviser: Some of you may prefer to travel by car, but 1 have to warn you about some changes to the roads. You will find there is a lot of new road work on <span class="explainq15 explain">Smith Street</span>. The work will not finish for a long time so we can be sure that Smith Street will be a problem.</p>

<p>If you are coming from the city you will be able to travel easily until you get to Blackwell Street, just near the college. As you know Blackwell Street is very’ long. You should avoid the comer of Blackwell Street and June’s Avenue, because they are <span class="explainq16 explain">laying telephone cable</span>. However, you can take a detour and avoid Blackwell Street altogether. The best thing to do is to pass the round-about and take the first road on your left which is Brown Crescent. Brown Crescent will lead you into <span class="explainq17 explain">the college grounds</span>, so that’s easy.</p>

<p>I hope everyone has a great time. Bring your friends, and we’ll see you on Friday. Oh, one final reminder: it’s best to use the <span class="explainq18 explain">side door</span>. The front door may be locked at 7.00, so come to the side. See you on Friday.</p>
