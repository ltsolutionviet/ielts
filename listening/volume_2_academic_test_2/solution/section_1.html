<div class="passage-content"> <h1>SECTION 1</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Good morning. May I help you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Oh, good morning. Is this the Student Job Centre?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Oh, yes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Urn… I was wondering if </span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you could tell me a bit about the job, you know, the Hotel </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruitment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program that offers a range of work at the hotels in the area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Of course, take a seat, please. I’ll take you through some of what we have on offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Thank you so much. Oh, wait a second and I’ll get my pen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: OK</span>. The first job is <span class="explainq1 explain">Reception Assistant</span> &nbsp;at the Parkview Hotel. The P<span style="font-weight: 400;">arkview Hotel has quite an </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">international</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">flavour, so you’ll need to speak at least two </span>foreign<span style="font-weight: 400;"> languages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Sure, I can speak fluent French and Spanish, so that’s no problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Good. And many guests, of course, travel by car, and you may have to take their </span>vehicles<span style="font-weight: 400;"> around to the car park, so you will need to have a valid </span><span class="explainq2 explain">driving license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you will not be </span>allowed<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do the job if you haven’t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: OK, I got that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Right. And they also say that basic computer skills such as word </span>processing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be an advantage, although this isn’t a requirement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Well, I just got my Computer Skills </span>certificate<span style="font-weight: 400;"> , so I have no worries about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: This is quite a varied job, and in fact I should point out that at certain times of the day it would involve <span class="explainq3 explain">heavy lifting</span> when guests’ luggage arrives or perhaps </span>deliveries<span style="font-weight: 400;"> come in. Is that OK for you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Well, it’s hard to say at this moment. But I’ll bear that in mind when deciding whether to apply for this post.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Sure. Another job is </span>general assistant<span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Lakeside Hotel. To be honest, the pay is rather low, but there are </span>compensatory<span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors, for example, the hotel will provide you with all your <span class="explainq4 explain">meals</span> while you’re working, and they will also train you in all the </span>aspects<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the job and then issue you with a </span><span class="explainq5 explain">certificate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , which, of course, could be very valuable to you in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Oh, that sounds great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Now… the third job on offer is Catering Assistant at Hotel 98 smart new </span>premises<span style="font-weight: 400;"> . As you know, this hotel is popular with </span>exclusive<span style="font-weight: 400;"> travelers and so you’ll need to wear the </span>distinctive<span class="explainq6 explain"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staff </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniform</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which you’re provided with. Don’t consider this job unless you’re fairly </span>flexible<span style="font-weight: 400;"> about when you work, as the hotel will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you to work nights for this job, and you will need to travel to and from the hotel, as it’s situated just outside the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Well. I’m afraid I can’t </span>manage<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that because of the lectures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: OK, I get the picture. </span>So, which one will you prefer, Reception Assistant at the Parkview Hotel or General Assistant at the Lakeside Hotel?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Well, I guess I still couldnt make up my mind right now. Can I have a few days to think about and go back to you later?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: That’s no problem. And there are a few things I need to clarify with you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to apply for one of these jobs, you will need to follow the </span>recruitment<span style="font-weight: 400;"> process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Mum…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: So the first thing you’ll need to do is to fill in o</span>ne of these – a <span class="explainq7 explain">personal information form</span>. It’s <span style="font-weight: 400;">pretty </span>straightforward<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and should only take you a few minutes. Once you’ve done that and handed it in, we’ll give you a </span><span class="explainq8 explain">questionnaire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about your skills. We then look through the information about you, and pass on our recommendations to the </span>relevant<span style="font-weight: 400;"> hotel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Yes, sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: You will then proceed to the next step of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">process and attend a general course of training. This is designed to be helpful and realistic, so an important part of the course is <span class="explainq9 explain">role-play&nbsp;activities</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: That sounds interesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: Yes, indeed. And after that, the final step is that you will be </span>contacted<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the hotel you’re going to work for, and they’ll post you a <span class="explainq10 explain">video</span> about themselves and the work </span>involved<span style="font-weight: 400;"> . Watching this will constitute further and specific training for your job.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Oh, yes. I think I’m very clear now. Thank you for helping me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agent: It’s a pleasure. Bye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student: Bye.</span></p>
