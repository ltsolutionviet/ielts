<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION&nbsp;2</strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning, everyone. I’m John Smith, the General </span><strong>practitioner</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of London Fields Medical Centre, and I’m very glad to give you a brief introduction about our </span><strong>practice</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some suggestions about how to see a doctor here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">receptionists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are usually the first point of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are here to help you. They have a lot of information to hand and in most </span><strong>cases</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to help you with your </span><strong>inquiry</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , ensuring you see the most appropriate </span><strong>clinician</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, right, well the first thing to do is to register. We can only accept new </span><strong>patients</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who live in our practice </span><strong>catchment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> area. To register with us you will need 2 proofs of address such as bank statements or tenancy </span><strong>agreements</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plus 1 form of ID such as passport or drivers’ license.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are </span><strong>foreign</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationals, then you’ll have to regis</span>ter as a <span class="explainq11 explain">temporary visitor</span>. Then, fill in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> this form. It’s a medical history form. You have to give details of any </span><strong>illnesses</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you have had. Then you also need to write down if you’ve got any </span><span class="explainq12 explain"><strong>allergies</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , OK? This as well as that, we need to know if you’ve had any </span><strong>operations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> … and last of all, you have to give full details of </span><span class="explainq13 explain">current medication </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you may be on. This as well as that, you need to fill in this </span><span class="explainq14 explain"><strong>registration card</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – this is for your personal details, thats your full name, address and telephone numbers. Okay? And we also need to make an </span><strong>appointment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you to see the doctor for a new patient health check. It’ll just take about 15 minutes, thats all. It’s just a basic </span><strong>checkup</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> really.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, then, let me tell you something about the health centre. We have 5 GPs here – general </span><strong>practitioners</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . <span class="explainq15 explain">We also have a practice nurse who looks after minor injuries </span>. She can also administer some </span><strong>treatments</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . We also have a </span><strong>chiro product</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . That’s a foot specialist. She’s private which means you have to <span class="explainq16 explain">pay for the service, unless you’re over 65</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to see a doctor, you have to make an appointment first. Please call our main </span><strong>switchboard</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">0207 9 23 8 100</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to book an appointment at either our main practice or one of our branch </span><strong>surgeries</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also email for an appointment on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">London Fields medical@NHS.net</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Urgent cases are seen on the day. If your condition is non-urgent, you can expect to see a GP within two working days, though you may have to wait longer if you want to see a particular GP.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s an </span><strong>emergency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , you’d better come straight here to the Centre, one of the doctors can usually see you, or you can go to the emergency </span><strong>department</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the hospital in town. If you are very sick, <span class="explainq17 explain">you can ask for a home visit as well.</span> On Friday afternoons we have an open </span><strong>surgery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which means you can come along and just wait to see a doctor, but you may have to wait for several hours, so it’s much better to </span><span class="explainq18 explain">make an appointment and come at the specified time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually when you see a doctor you’ll be given a </span><strong>prescription</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for medicine which you need to take. Or you can choose to go to a </span><strong>pharmacist</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a chemist’s shop. If the doctor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">decides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you will need the medication for a long time, <span class="explainq19 explain">you will be given a repeat prescription form.</span> This allows you to get a further </span><strong>supply</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without seeing the doctor again. You simply leave the repeat form here a few days before you need it. Then you pick up the medication at the </span><strong>chemists</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, you may wonder how much this all costs? Well, there is no charge for seeing a doctor – you can make an </span><strong>appointment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anytime to see one of our doctors and it will not cost you anything for the </span><strong>consultation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, you need to </span><span class="explainq20 explain">pay for the prescription and the cost varies with the medicine, but its usually just a few pounds. Nevertheless, in some situations, such as pregnancy, the prescription is then free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right, do you have any other questions?</span></p>
