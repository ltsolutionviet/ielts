<p class="text-align-justify">The London Eye</p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today I want to focus on some of the major sights that attract </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tourists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cities, and I am going to begin with the London Eye. The London Eye is London’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> major tourist attraction. It is a huge wheel designed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Millennium year 2000, so it’s also known as the <span class="explainq31 explain">Millennium</span> Wheel. It stands at Millennium Pier, on the South Bank of the <span class="explainq32 explain">River Thames</span>, close to the south end of Westminster Bridge, and within an easy walk of the Houses of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parliament</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Big Ben. Though it looks like a huge Ferris wheel, the London Eye is no </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairground</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thrill- ride, but a slow and stately way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> London in a unique way. The London Eye is the UK’s most popular paid for visitor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attraction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, visited by over <span class="explainq33 explain">3.5 million</span> people a year.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eye was built between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1998 and 2000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It seems </span>remarkable<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a site that has so quickly become a symbol of modem London has been around for such a short time! It took fully seven years from start of the design </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create the Eye. It was intended to stand for only a few years, but it proved to be such a popular </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attraction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the decision was made to make the wheel a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">permanent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature of the London landscape. The Eye was </span>referred<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by <span class="explainq34 explain">British Airways</span>, and for several years after opening it was referred to as the British Airways </span>Millennium<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wheel. Today the London Eye is under the </span>ownership<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the London Eye Company, a </span>subsidiary<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Merlin Entertainments Group Company.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing The Merlin Entertainments London Eye was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenge. It’s the tallest cantilevered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">observation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wheel in the world, rising high above the London skyline at </span><span class="explainq34 explain explainq35" style="font-weight: 400;">135 metres</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was a piece of daring innovation and </span>revolutionary<span style="font-weight: 400;"> design which combined the best of British design, architecture and engineering with an exceptional team of experts.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how is that great wheel held up? How did it get there? The starting point was, of course, the ground, and while parts of the wheel itself were still being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constructed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in various countries</span>, <span class="explainq36 explain">tension piles</span> were being driven into the ground beside the River Thames. This was the first step, and once these were securely in place, a base cap was installed over them as a kind of lock, with two giant blimps pointing up, onto which a frame was attached , like a giant letter. The wheel was supported on huge <span class="explainq37 explain">A-frame</span> legs, made up of 2,200 tonnes of concrete on 44 concrete piles set 33 meters deep in the earth. All this took many months and incredible effort, but meant that the spindle could be installed, around which the great wheel would turn. The spindle itself was too large to cast as a single piece so instead was produced in eight smaller sections. Now the project really was in business, and the vast <span class="explainq38 explain">rim </span>with spokes like an outsized bicycle wheel could be brought in. 64 spoke cables, which are similar to bicycle spokes, hold the rim tight to the central spindle. And the view was enhanced by the capsule design; unlike traditional ferris wheel designs that you might see at a local fairground, the <span class="explainq39 explain">passenger capsules</span> were not suspended under the wheel, they were set within a circular mounting ring attached to the outside surface of the wheel. What this means in practice is that travelers within the capsule have a full 360 degree panoramic view, unhindered by spokes of wheel struts. And the last thing to be built is the first thing the visitor encounters, the <span class="explainq40 explain">boarding platform</span> laid down underneath. The wheel does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level. It is, however, stopped to allow disabled or elderly passengers time to embark and disembark safely.&nbsp;</p>
