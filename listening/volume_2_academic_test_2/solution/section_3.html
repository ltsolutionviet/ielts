<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: Until recently, we knew almost nothing about how important bees are in </span>maintaining<span style="font-weight: 400;"> natural </span>diversity<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now we know more about them. We know, for example, that bees fall into two categories: wild bees and </span>domesticated<span style="font-weight: 400;"> honeybees. A main reason for the domestication of bees has always been the production of honey and </span><span class="explainq21 explain">beeswax</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also know that honeybees are the </span>dominant<span style="font-weight: 400;"> pollinators. In addition to bees, wasps, moths, butterflies, flies and </span>beetles<span style="font-weight: 400;"> , as many as </span>1,500 species <span style="font-weight: 400;">of birds and mammals serve as pollinators. Many crops of </span>commercial<span style="font-weight: 400;"> importance such as almond, cherry, <span class="explainq22 explain">avocado pear</span>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">watermelon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , cucumber, rely on pollination by </span>insects<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and of these insects, bees are by far the most important. Animals and insects provide </span>pollination services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for over three-quarters of the staple crop plants and for 80% of all flowering plants in the world. The economic value of animal pollination to world </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">agriculture</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been estimated to be </span><span class="explainq23 explain">200 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> US dollars per year. Pollination is one of nature’s services to farmers. So think about this: if you </span>eliminated<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the pollinators, it would take the food right out of our mouths. We </span>biologists<span style="font-weight: 400;"> never imagined we’d see the day when wild plants or crops suffered from </span>pollinator<span style="font-weight: 400;"> scarcity. But, unfortunately, that day has come. In fact, farmers in Mexico and the U.S. are suffering the worst pollinator </span>crisis<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in history. So… what happened? Any ideas? Alicia?</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia: Is it…um… because of natural enemies? I read something about a kind of parasite that’s killed lots of bees.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: It’s true. An outbreak of </span>parasitic<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mites has caused a steep decline in North American populations of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">honeybees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span class="explainq24 explain">parasites </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t the only factor.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia: What about the pesticides used on farms? All those chemicals must have an effect.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: Most definitely, yes. Pesticides are a major factor. Both wild and domesticated bees are in </span>serious trouble<span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of pesticides. In California</span><span class="explainq25 explain">, farm chemicals </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are killing around 10% &nbsp;of all the honeybee colonies. Agriculture in general is part of the problem. Another example is the </span>monarch butterfly<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Millions of monarchs from all over the U.S. and southern Canada fly south every year in late summer. <span class="explainq26 explain">The monarch is the only butterfly that returns to a specific site year after year. </span>Unfortunately, the herbicides &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">used in their milkweed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Great Plains are taking a toll on monarchs, and fewer of them are reaching their winter grounds in Mexico. In a recent field study at Cornell University in the U.S., it was found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monarch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> butterfly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">caterpillars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eating com toxic pollen blown on to milkweed plants near com fields had suffered significant adverse effects leading to death of nearly 20% &nbsp;of the caterpillars.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia: Wow, 20%, thats so tragic!</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: And it’s more than that. There are over 1,500 species of butterflies in the Indian </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subcontinent, but <span class="explainq27 explain">their population is dwindling because of environmental changes. Many manmade environmental changes like deforestation, extension of farming and unrestricted urbanization are threatening some species of butterflies to extinction by destruction or disturbance of their larval as well as adult food plants, feeding grounds and shelters</span>. Many of the most spectacular and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">endangered species have various levels of protection under local legislation. However, <span class="explainq28 explain">there is a major trade in the spectacular tropical species for incorporation in ornaments and souvenirs.</span> The international demand for insects is greater than most people realize.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia: Yes, indeed. I once read an article about another important pollinator – the long-nosed bat. <span class="explainq29 explain">These amazing animals feed on cactus flowers. But they are having a tough time, too</span>. Some desert </span>ranchers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mistake them for </span>vampire<span style="font-weight: 400;"> bats, and they’ve tried to poison them, or dynamite the caves where they roost.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: Yes, we must recognize that pollination is not a free service, and that investment and </span>stewardship<span style="font-weight: 400;"> are required to protect and sustain it, so what can be done about this situation?</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia: Well, wildlife farming, you know, based on sustainable exploiting wild creatures, can help to save endangered species like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">butterflies and their habitats. </span><span class="explainq30 explain">Besides, gardeners, orchard growers, farmers and urban dwellers can switch to more pollinator-friendly organic methods of cultivation to reduce wildlife exposures to insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor: That’s rightl Actually, the focus of beekeeping needs to change from conventional honey production to crop pollination.</span></p>
