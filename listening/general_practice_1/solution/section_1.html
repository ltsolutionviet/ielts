<p>You will hear a conversation between two women as one of the women buys a bus pass.<br>
<br>
Woman 1: Good morning. I’m here to get a student passport please.<br>
<br>
Woman 2: Of course Madam. Do you want to buy a month passport , a&nbsp;six-month&nbsp;passport or a year pass?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp; 1: Oh, just <span class="explainqe explain">a month</span> passport please.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp; 2:&nbsp;Right then. I’ll just have to take a few&nbsp;details&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Yes. Of course.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: First of all, what’s your name?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Nathalie&nbsp;Janeson&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: And how do you spell Janeson?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: <span class="explainq1 explain">J-A-N-E-S-O-N.</span><br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Thank you. And what’s your address?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: 45 <span class="explainq2 explain">Forest Avenue</span>, Newlands, Adelaide.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Is that Forest with 1 R or 2 Rs?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Just 1.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: And what’s the postcode please?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Oh yes… It’s&nbsp;eight four nine oh.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Thanks. Now what’s your date of birth … If you don’t mind me asking?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Not at all. It’s the&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">13th of May</span>, 1982.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: I also need to know your telephone number here in Adelaide.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: OK. I just need to check that as I only moved here last week. Now, where is it. Here we are. It’s&nbsp;<span class="explainq4 explain">six two four nine seven one five two</span>&nbsp;Do you need a code or anything?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Oh no, that’s OK thank you. Can I see your university card please?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Yes, here it is.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Good. That’s fine. Now, for which zone do you need a pass?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Well, I’m not sure. I was hoping you’d be able to help me as I don’t really know my way around here yet. As you know, I live in&nbsp;newlands&nbsp;and I have to get to the university campus ir the centre of town every day.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Well, the university is in Zone 1 and Newlands has 2 zones. The side nearer to the town centre is&nbsp;owned five&nbsp;but the far side is&nbsp;owned six&nbsp;. What road is it you live in again?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Forest Avenue.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Let’s see on this map. There it is. The nearest bus stop is in Zone 5. That’s lucky. Zones 1 – 6 are&nbsp;six or fifteen dollars&nbsp;more expensive<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Great! Make the pass out for Zones <span class="explainq5 explain">1 – 5</span> then please.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: I’ve got some other questions too if you don’t mind.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Sure. Go ahead.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Well, this weekend my friend and I aren’t doing anything so we thought we’d take a trip out of town and visit somewhere new. Does the bus&nbsp;service&nbsp;run any trips like that?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Yes, we’ve got a selection of trips. I’ll tell you about some of them.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Thanks.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Right the first one goes up to MacDonald Nature Park. The bus leaves at&nbsp;8 o'clock&nbsp;and takes about 2 hours to get there and leaves for the return at<span class="explainq6 explain"> 4.30 in the afternoon</span>. Once there you can walk around the nature&nbsp;trails&nbsp;. It’s really nice and the Macdonald River runs through there and that’s really beautiful so take a&nbsp;camera&nbsp;with you. Then there’s the Pearl Bay trip. The bus leaves at&nbsp;9:00 a.m.&nbsp;and goes up the coast to Pearl Bay.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: How far is that?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: <span class="explainq7 explain">It’s an hour away.</span> Once there you can walk along <span class="explainq8 explain">the&nbsp;cliffs</span>&nbsp;up to Rocky Point, which has a famous view up the coast, or you can just lie on the beach and swim. Don’t forget to take your swimming gear and a towel! The water’s pretty safe there and there are always&nbsp;lifeguards&nbsp;. The bus arrives back in Adelaide at&nbsp;5:00&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Mm. That sounds nice. What else?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: Well there’s the Huron Gold Mine. It’s just a half-day trip leaving here at 9.30am<span class="explainq9 explain"> and arriving back at 2.00pm.</span> It only takes half an hour to get there which is good. It’s an old worked out mine that has been&nbsp;changed&nbsp;into a sort of&nbsp;museum&nbsp;. They have all the old&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;and a guide takes you round some of the&nbsp;tunnels&nbsp;and shows you some of the techniques they used to use. You might even find some gold they&nbsp;missed&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Yeah. I could do with that.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: It’s pretty interesting but the mines can be quite cold so take <span class="explainq10 explain">a&nbsp;sweater</span>&nbsp;. So, how do those three sound?<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Quite interesting. I really like the idea of going up the&nbsp;coast&nbsp;and spending a day on the beach but my friend Karen will like the idea of the nature park. I’d better wait and&nbsp;check outwith her what she wants to do before booking.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: No problem at all. You just need to pop in some time during the week and we’ll make the booking.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;1: Thanks very much. You’ve been very&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Woman&nbsp;2: No problem. See you later.</p>
