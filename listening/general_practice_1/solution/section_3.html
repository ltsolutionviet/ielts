<p>You will hear 3 students discussing a survey they are going to do<br>
<br>
Phil: Hi Mel. Hi Laura. Sorry I’m a bit late. I got held up by the bus. It just didn’t come for ages.<br>
<br>
Mel: Don’t worry. You’re only a couple of minutes behind and we’ve only just been <span class="explainq21 explain">chatting</span>.<br>
<br>
Laura: Right then. We’re here to&nbsp;organize&nbsp;the survey that we’re going to do. Mel, you said that you’d&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;with Professor Donald Walker what type of survey we were going to do.<br>
<br>
Mel: Yes. I spoke to Professor Walker two days ago and I told him that the&nbsp;surveys&nbsp;that we were&nbsp;considering&nbsp;were a telephone survey, a street survey and a mail survey. He thought that the phone one would be <span class="explainq22 explain">too expensive</span> for us and the&nbsp;postal&nbsp;one would <span class="explainq23 explain">take too long</span> so we decided we should do the street one.<br>
<br>
Phil: I think that’s right. If we do the street one then we can get the whole thing done in one day and we can get on with&nbsp;analyzing&nbsp;the results.<br>
<br>
Mel: Yes, that’s right. Now, there are some other things that Professor Walker wanted to know about. How big should the survey be?<br>
<br>
Laura: Well, the ideal figure for a survey such as this should be about<span class="explainq24 explain">&nbsp;a thousand</span> people&nbsp;but that will take us about a month to get that many people and we just don’t have that much time. On the other hand, if we just choose 100 people, the survey won’t be<span class="explainq25 explain">&nbsp;statistically significant.</span><br>
<br>
Phil: So, what about something in the middle. What about&nbsp;600&nbsp;?<br>
<br>
Mel: Still too many. That’ll take us ages. 400?<br>
<br>
Laura: Let’s split the difference and say <span class="explainq26 explain">500</span>.<br>
<br>
Mel/Phil: OK<br>
<br>
Laura: And how many questions? If there are too many we’ll just have the same problem.<br>
<br>
Mel: Professor Walker said we should have no more than 10 or people get&nbsp;bored ten&nbsp;. 10 then?<br>
<br>
Phil: I think even fewer. 8.<br>
<span class="explainq27 explain">Laura: I think 3 fewer again to make sure we can get the numbers done&nbsp;quickly okay&nbsp;. </span></p>

<p><span class="explainq27 explain">Phil: OK, I agree with that.</span><br>
<br>
Mel: I’m not sure but I&nbsp;suppose&nbsp;so.<br>
<br>
Mel: Now, Professor Walker asked where we were going to do the survey.<br>
<br>
Laura: Does he want to avoid that area then?<br>
<br>
Mel: Probably! Now we can either all stay together or split up and do different&nbsp;locations&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Laura: Well, if we split up then I think we’ve got a better chance of getting more people&nbsp;surveyed&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Phil: Yes. I agree with Laura.<br>
<br>
Mel: OK. Now, I made a list of the possible locations in Westley where we could station&nbsp;ourselves<span class="explainq28 explain">&nbsp;</span><span class="explainq29 explain">. <span class="explainq30 explain">There’s the town square, at the&nbsp;entrance&nbsp;to the train station, at the University cafeteria, outside Dobbins&nbsp;department&nbsp;store, on the corner of the High Street and College road, the bus station and the corner of the High Street and Wilkins Road.</span></span> What do you think?<br>
<br>
Phil: I think the square is great but the people at the train station will be&nbsp;traveling&nbsp;and often in a hurry.<br>
<br>
Laura: I agree with all that and I think the bus station will have the same problem as the train station.<br>
<br>
Mel: OK, that’s those two out then.<br>
<br>
Laura: I think the other ones in town were good too. The&nbsp;cafeteria&nbsp;will have too many students and that will create too great a bias to our&nbsp;survey&nbsp;. We need a good cross section of the population and anywhere too close to the university won’t give us that.<br>
<br>
Phil: Laura’s right. So, out of the other town ones, I think that the two on the High Street corners are good.<br>
<br>
Mel: I don’t agree. The High Street corner with College Road will be good but the corner with Wilkins Road is too far out. Not enough people will come by there.<br>
<br>
Laura: Yes, Mel’s right there. We should use Dobbins&nbsp;department&nbsp;store instead.<br>
<br>
Phil: I can see your point. OK, that’s settled then. All three of us will be&nbsp;stationed&nbsp;in town then but not the Wilkins Road position.</p>
