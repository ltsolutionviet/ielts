<br>
Good morning everyone and welcome to this further education lecture on&nbsp;marine&nbsp;biology. Today we are going to look at the&nbsp;coelacanth&nbsp;. <span class="explainq31 explain">The discovery of the coelacanth has been compared to finding a&nbsp;dinosaur&nbsp;walking around today over&nbsp;85 million&nbsp;years after it went extinct.</span><br>
<br>
The story began a few days before Christmas in&nbsp;1938&nbsp;when the first living coelacanth was discovered off the east coast of South Africa, at the mouth of the Chalumna River. <span class="explainq34 explain">The fish was caught in a shark gill net by&nbsp;captain&nbsp;Goosen and his crew who, recognising the&nbsp;bizarrenature of their catch, alerted the local&nbsp;museum&nbsp;in the small South African town of East London.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="explainq32 explain">The Director of the East London Museum at the time was Miss Marjorie Courtney-Latimer after whom the Coelacanth was eventually named. Miss Courtney-Latimer offered bounties to&nbsp;fishermen&nbsp;for unfamiliar fish.</span> It was Miss Courtney-Latimer who alerted the&nbsp;prominentSouth African&nbsp;exci&nbsp;<span class="explainq31 explain">Dr J.L.B. Smith, who initially identified the fish</span>, and&nbsp;subsequentlyinformed the world about this amazing discovery. This first coelacanth led to the discovery of the first documented population, off the remote Comoros Islands, between the mainland of Africa and&nbsp;madagascar&nbsp;. For 60 years this was presumed to be the only coelacanth population in&nbsp;existence&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Originally it was a concern that the Coelacanth might have a very limited range and that&nbsp;over fishing&nbsp;along the Comoros Islands might wipe it out. However, scientists were amazed when, on&nbsp;july the 30th 1998&nbsp;, <span class="explainq35 explain">an American scientist discovered a Coelacanth population in Indonesia.</span> Dr. Mark Erdmann was on a&nbsp;honeymoon&nbsp;trip to the area investigating a coral reef research site when he&nbsp;spotted&nbsp;a strange fish being&nbsp;wheeled&nbsp;into the fish market. <span class="explainq33 explain">He recognized the fish as a coelacanth and&nbsp;snapped&nbsp;a picture before it was sold.</span><br>
<br>
Dr. Erdmann’s subsequent research&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;that the people from Sulawesi had a name for it, raja, ‘king of the sea’. The Sulawesi coelacanth colony is about&nbsp;10,000 kilometers&nbsp;east of where the Coelacanths were previously known to occur in the Western Indian Ocean.<br>
<br>
Both Sulawesi and Comoros coelacanths are quite different from all other living fish. But perhaps the most interesting feature of the Coelacanth is that it has paired, lobed fins, which move in a similar fashion to our arms and legs. Coelacanths also have an extra&nbsp;lobe&nbsp;on their tail and a&nbsp;vertebral&nbsp;column that is not fully developed. They are the only living animal to have a fully functional&nbsp;inter-cranial&nbsp;joint, a division that separates the ear and brain from the nasal organs and eye, and allows the front part of the head to be&nbsp;lifted&nbsp;when the fish is feeding. <span class="explainq36 explain">The brown Sulawesi coelacanth and the steel blue Comoros&nbsp;shared&nbsp;share these unusual characteristics.</span><br>
<br>
The discovery of the Coelacanth in 1938 is still considered to be the&nbsp;zoological&nbsp;find of the century. This living fossil comes from a lineage of fish that was thought to have been extinct since the time of the dinosaurs. Coelacanths are known from the&nbsp;fossil&nbsp;record dating back over&nbsp;360 million&nbsp;years, and peaked in <span class="explainq37 explain">abundance about 240 million years ago</span>. Before 1938 they were believed to have become extinct&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;80 million years ago, after&nbsp;mysteriously&nbsp;disappearing from the fossil record.<br>
<br>
How could the Coelacanth disappear for over 80 million years and then turn up alive and well in the&nbsp;20th&nbsp;century? The answer seems to be that fossil Coelacanths appeared to live in environments with clay&nbsp;sedimentation&nbsp;with plenty of&nbsp;volcanic&nbsp;activity. <span class="explainq38 explain">Modern coelacanths, both in the Comoros and Sulawesi inhabit caves and&nbsp;overhangs&nbsp;in vertical marine reefs, at about&nbsp;200 metres&nbsp;, environments not&nbsp;conducive&nbsp;to fossil creation.</span><br>
<br>
In 1991 scientists got a better understanding of the fish when<span class="explainq39 explain"> the Comoros got their independence from France and French&nbsp;restrictions&nbsp;on research were lifted</span>. This allowed scientists to study the fish off the Comoros Islands. As the animal hides in underwater caves some 300 to&nbsp;700&nbsp;feet down during the day and <span class="explainq40 explain">comes out at night to feed, diving is not an option and previously only&nbsp;fisherman&nbsp;specimens had been available for study</span>. But this time the scientists had their own&nbsp;submarine&nbsp;so they could study the coelacanth in its natural habitat through&nbsp;portholes&nbsp;.</p>
