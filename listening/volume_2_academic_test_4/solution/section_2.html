<p><em>You will hear an introduction about sports matches.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning everyone. I am Mary White, the </span><strong>Secretary </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Exciting Sports Club. Welcome to attend matches </span><strong>arrangement </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting. I know you are looking forward to a great </span><strong>season </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now I’d like to give you a short introduction to our arrangement in this season.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This season we still have two </span><strong>competitions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One is tennis and the other is soccer. Let’s start with tennis. There will be <span class="explainq11 explain">six</span> teams competition. We hope the players’ ages are between 16 and 22 </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">years old. While the number of soccer teams is only four in this season. Because we hope all players’ ages are no more than </span><span class="explainq12 explain"><strong>20</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> years old. Now, in this new season there are some changes. The first one is the </span><span class="explainq13 explain"><strong>venue </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will arrange all our matches for both the tennis and soccer competitions in Magic Park instead of Darry Park which was used last year. Tennis matches</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will be arranged on court 2 and <span class="explainq14 explain">court 4</span> will hold soccer matches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our match schedule</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all tennis matches will be played on <span class="explainq15 explain">Sunday afternoons</span>. All matches will begin at 2 o'clock. Soccer matches in this season will be played at 7 o’clock on Saturday evenings. The joining fee is still </span><strong>30 pounds </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">including a new sport gear. We still offer a week of training session before formal match for our new players. There are two training session at 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on next Friday and Saturday afternoon. The fee is only </span><strong>12 pounds</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now I’d like to introduce the <span class="explainq16 explain">coach</span> of each training session. George Hansen who has been </span><strong>supervised </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the tennis teams for over four years will still be coach this season. While, we will invite a good soccer coach who has enough </span><strong>patience </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and professional skills to work as this season soccer coach. His name is <span class="explainq17 explain">Paul Bhatt</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we offer some activities to thank all players. Please look at your </span><strong>brochure </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are some activities and their time </span><strong>arrangements</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At beginning we hope to start the season with a </span><span class="explainq18 explain">barbecue dinner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on next Saturday in Magic Park. I do really hope all players will go there to enjoy the dinner and you may invite your </span><strong>relatives </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and friends. Of course they have to pay a listed fee with just 5 pounds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, after the final match in this season, we will vote this season’s <span class="explainq19 explain">MVP</span> (the most valuable player). The two players from tennis team and soccer team will gain an </span><strong>honour </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a prize</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from our sports centre. This season we hope all players can send a <span class="explainq20 explain">confirm letter</span> to us to </span><strong>ensure </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">our match arrangement. So please write to us before the </span><strong>deadline </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– it is on Thursday, 18th April. Our secretary – David Black – is in charge of collecting fees and your letters in this season. His room number is </span><strong>214 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and his phone is </span><strong>332567 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(fade)…</span></p>
