<p>Welcome to this introductory lecture on the Celts. Who were the Celts? The Celts were an Indo-European group, that is, related linguistically to the Greeks, the Germanic peoples, certain Italic groups and peoples of the Indian <strong>subcontinent</strong>. They arose in central Europe at the beginning of the first &nbsp;<strong>millennium</strong> B.C. and were an <span class="explainq31 explain">iron</span> using and horse rearing peoples. By the end of the first millennium B.C. their cultural group had spread up and down the Danube and Rhine, taking in Gaul, Ireland and Britain, &nbsp;<strong>across</strong> central Europe, into northern Italy and northern Spain. Their roaming across Europe led some of the Celtic &nbsp;<strong>tribes</strong> to sack Rome in 390 B.C. creating a fear of the northern &nbsp;<strong>barbarians</strong> that was to haunt Romans for hundreds of years to come.</p>

<p><br>
The Celts are defined <strong>archaeologically</strong> by the type-sites of Hallstatt and La Tene, the former being taken to relate to an earlier phase of cultural <strong>development</strong>. Hallstatt, an ancient salt mining area, was &nbsp;<strong>excavated</strong> from <span class="explainq32 explain">1876</span> onwards by the Viennese Academy of Sciences and provided the first classification of the <strong>prehistoric</strong> Celts. In <span class="explainq33 explain">1858</span>, the waters of Lake Neuchatel in &nbsp;Switzerland sunk to a low level, revealing a large &nbsp;<strong>prehistoric</strong> settlement with a huge number of surviving <strong>artifacts</strong>. The nearby town of La Tene gave its name to the second phase of Celtic cultural development. However, please note that these phases &nbsp;<strong>overlap</strong> through time, and are defined according to geographical area. Let’s look at each of these, taking the Hallstatt first.<br>
Hallstatt culture is &nbsp;<strong>characterized</strong> in <span class="explainq34 explain">4 stages</span>. A &amp; B were during the late Bronze Age, from about 1200 to 700 BC ; C was in the Early Iron Age, from about 700-600 BC; D was from about 600 to 475 BC. The Hallstatt culture &nbsp;<strong>spanned</strong> central Europe, with its centre in the area around Hallstatt in Central Austria. There were two &nbsp;<strong>distinct</strong> cultural zones – the eastern and the western. At the start of the period, long distance trade was already well <strong>established</strong> in <span class="explainq35 explain">copper and tin</span> – the basic requirements for manufacture of &nbsp;bronze. From about 700 BC, trade in iron also became established. The Hallstatt area also already controlled the trade in salt, <strong>crucial</strong> when there were few other means to&nbsp;<strong>preserve</strong> food. Control of these two crucial trade goods—iron and salt—provided the basis for the &nbsp;<strong>accumulation</strong> of wealth and influence. From 800 BC, some burials of rich people can be identified, in central Europe, with grave goods such as wheeled wagons and iron <strong>swords</strong>.<br>
Hallstatt C saw the construction of fortified <span class="explainq36 explain">hilltop</span>&nbsp;settlements to the North of the Alps. These had <strong>burial</strong> mounds holding very high quality goods, such as vehicles and expensive <strong>imported</strong> treasures. By the time of the Hallstatt D period, these increasingly extravagant burial mounds were &nbsp;<strong>clustered</strong> around a few major hill forts to the southwest of the region. This suggests a development and a concentration of wealth and social power, possibly based on the development of Massilia (present-day Marseilles) as a Greek trading port. The <strong>expansion</strong> of <span class="explainq37 explain">luxury trade</span> brought greater opportunities for profit and helped to create an increasingly&nbsp;<strong>stratified</strong> society, with the development of a wealthy <strong>nobility</strong>. Over the period from 1846 to 1863, a thousand &nbsp;<strong>graves</strong> were found at Hallstatt, with an astonishing range of <strong>artefacts</strong>, including clothing and salt mining equipment as well as weapons, jewellery, pottery and imported bronze &nbsp;<strong>vessels</strong> in the “chieftains’” graves.</p>

<p><br>
The La Tene era was the time of Celtic <span class="explainq38 explain">expansion and migration</span> and the time of formation of the myths, The La Tene culture is named after the site in Switzerland where it was first discovered. The La Tene people were those known to the Romans as Gaids. Originally found in an area from Eastern France to Bohemia, the La Tene culture <span class="explainq39 explain">spread rapidly</span> from about 400 BC. The La Tene Celts settled in Spain in 450 BC, in Northern Italy in 400 BC, invaded Rome in 390 BC, &nbsp;<strong>invaded</strong> Greece in 279 BC, invaded Galatia (in modern Turkey) in 270 BC. By 200 BC, they &nbsp;<strong>occupied</strong> the lands that are now Britain, the Netherlands, Brittany, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>There is much debate over how much of the &nbsp;<strong>expansion</strong> into Britain was achieved through invasion and settlement and how much was the expression of cultural transfer that &nbsp;<strong>accompanied</strong> trade and reflected the commonality of kinship and language of many tribes. There is little evidence for actual &nbsp;<strong>migration</strong> of La Tene people into Britain. Nevertheless, it does appear that the La Tene culture was more &nbsp;<strong>militarily</strong> than the Hallstatt one. The La Tene <span class="explainq40 explain"><strong>graves</strong></span> across Europe hold iron weapons – swords and spearheads – and wooden shields, as well as everyday items such as razors, yokes, cauldrons and jewelry.</p>
