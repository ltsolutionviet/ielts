<p>Carlos: OK, everyone. Let’s look at what&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;tips we have come up with for our next seminar. Melissa?</p>

<p>Melissa: OK, here’s my first tip. <span class="explainq21 explain">Show up early</span>. Some&nbsp;<strong>experience&nbsp;</strong>presenters say that something good is&nbsp;<strong>bound&nbsp;</strong>to happen! I’m not sure about that, but…<br>
David: Well,… you may have a chance to head off some&nbsp;<strong>technical&nbsp;</strong>problem. Also, at the beginning, before you actually begin your presentation, people&nbsp;<strong>filter&nbsp;</strong>in slowly. It’s a great time to introduce yourself.&nbsp;<br>
Melissa: Can’t argue with that! Simona had some ideas about opening.<br>
Simona: Have a strong opening. I picked up a few ideas for&nbsp;<strong>structuring&nbsp;</strong>your opening. First, never&nbsp;<span class="explainq22 explain"><strong>apologize</strong></span>. If you’re worried the presentation won’t go well, keep it to yourself and give it your best shot. Besides, people are usually too&nbsp;<strong>preoccupied&nbsp;</strong>with their own problems to notice yours.&nbsp;<br>
Carlos: I like that!<br>
Simona: Open by addressing the following three questions: What’s the problem? Who cares? What’s your solution?<br>
Carlos: Excellent suggestion! David? You’ve gone quiet!<br>
David: Well, my next suggestion is PGP. That means that with every subtopic, you should move from the <span class="explainq23 explain">Particular to the General and back to the Particular</span>. Even though the <strong>purpose</strong> of a subtopic is to convey the general information, bracing it with particulars is a good way to <span class="explainq24 explain">draw attention</span> and promote <strong>retention</strong>.<br>
Melissa: I’ve got another one. This might not be a tip so much as a law.&nbsp;<br>
Give everyone at least one piece of paper. A piece of paper is a record from your presentation. People can use that to help recall the details of the presentation, or better yet to tell others about it.<br>
Carlos: The next tip that I have is <span class="explainq25 explain">know your audience</span>. This is, of course, a general piece of advice for public speaking. See if you can find out what styles of information presentation they are most familiar and comfortable with. Adapting your presentation to those styles will leave fewer barriers to the direct communication of your material.&nbsp;<br>
Simona: I like that idea. We mentioned possible technical problems before.<br>
My next point is that maybe speakers should <strong>rethink</strong> the overhead projector. Is one really necessary?<br>
David: I&nbsp;think that often it is. but <span class="explainq26 explain">I agree with your basic point</span>, Simona.&nbsp;<br>
Don’t use one just because it’s there. Maybe a good tip is to consider carefully what you are putting on your <strong>slides</strong>.<br>
Simona: Yes, David, that’s a very good point to make. Slide content is …<br>
well, you don’t want too much … too little. Carlos?<br>
Carlos: Good points, both of you. Another point I have is to <strong>respect</strong> the audience. Don’t condescend by “dumbing down” your lecture. Show them respect by saying what you believe and what you know to be the whole story.<br>
Melissa: I also have a point about <strong>humor</strong>. I think that humour is generally good, but be careful with it. <span class="explainq27 explain">Humour in a presentation works best</span> when it actually drives the presentation forward. If you find you’re using <strong>canned jokes</strong> that don’t depend on the context, of the presentation, <strong>eliminate</strong> them David?&nbsp;<br>
David: Maybe, Melissa, but always be very careful about jokes that. put.<br>
down a class of people. If you’re going to <strong>alienate</strong> your audience, do it on the <strong>merits</strong> of your content.<br>
Simona: Also, avoid masculine-or even &nbsp;<strong>feminine pronouns</strong> as universal. It can be a nuisance to half the audience. As universal, use the plural “they”. The Oxford English Dictionary has allowed “they” as a gender <strong>neutral</strong> singular pronoun for years.<br>
Carlos: Thanks, Simona. Thinking towards the end. <span class="explainq28 explain">Take care with questions</span>. Many people &nbsp;<strong>judge</strong> the quality of your talk not by the twenty minutes of presentation, but on the thirty seconds <span class="explainq28 explain">you spend answering their question</span>. Be sure to allow long pauses for questions. Ten seconds may seem like a long pause when you’re at the front of the room, but. it flows &nbsp;<strong>naturally</strong> from the audience’s point of view.&nbsp;<br>
Simona: Let people know you believe your material. Speak with&nbsp;<strong>conviction</strong>.<br>
Believing your subject, matter is one of the best ways to speak more effectively!<br>
Melissa: <span class="explainq29 explain">Finish early, and something good is almost bound to happen</span>. If nothing else, people will be able to leave early, and <strong>suddenly</strong> they’ll have an extra couple of minutes to do things they didn’t think they’d get to. People will really like you if you do that.<br>
David: I think we have &nbsp;<strong>missed</strong> a key point. Practice! Practice over and over and over. If you can, record your presentation. Play it back and watch yourself. You’ll <strong>discover</strong> a thousand horrible things&nbsp;you never knew about yourself. Now watch it again without the sound. Why are your hands flying around like that? Now listen to it without the picture. Get rid of those urns! Now watch it at twice the normal speed. This &nbsp;<strong>emphasizes</strong> low frequency cycles in your gestures.<br>
Carlos: David, those were excellent points! I have one more. Something quite simple, but often overlooked. I read that the two most &nbsp;<strong>dehydrating</strong> things you can do in modern <strong>civilization</strong> are live presentations and air travel. I don’t know if it’s really true, but the &nbsp;<strong>message</strong> is that, the way to stay sharp is to <span class="explainq30 explain">drink lots of water</span>. Take care of your body, especially your voice. If possible, avoid <strong>alcohol</strong> too.&nbsp;<br>
Melissa: So, we’ve got to organise these points now…</p>
