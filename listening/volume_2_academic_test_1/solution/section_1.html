<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION 1</strong></h1>

<p>Cindy: So, Bob, how many people have said that they’re coming on the&nbsp;company picnic&nbsp;?<br>
Bob: Well, Cindy, we’ve got 35&nbsp;definite&nbsp;and another 10 probable.<br>
Cindy: Shall we say <span class="explainq1 explain">50</span>?&nbsp;<br>
Bob: I&nbsp;think so. And we’ve&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;the date for…?<br>
Cindy: <span class="explainq2 explain">26th</span>. The last Sunday in <span class="explainq2 explain">August</span>.&nbsp;<br>
Bob: Great! I hope the weather is good.<br>
Cindy: Should be. Now, we have to decide where to order the food from and what kind of things we want.<br>
Bob: Right. What’s our budget?<br>
Cindy: We decided to go for <span class="explainq3 explain">£10</span> a head for food and <span class="explainq3 explain">£5</span> a head for drinks.&nbsp;<br>
Bob: OK. I got some&nbsp;pamphlets&nbsp;from caterers. What do you think?<br>
Cindy: The most important thing is to make sure there’s a&nbsp;variety&nbsp;of food. We don’t want people&nbsp;complaining&nbsp;that they don’t like anything.<br>
Bob: We also don’t want food that could&nbsp;deteriorate in the sun-<span class="explainq4 explain">ice cream</span>, that kind of thing.<br>
Cindy: You’ve seen these pamphlets. What do you think?<br>
Bob: Well, I thought Paris Kitchen looked good. The price almost exactly meets our&nbsp;budget&nbsp;and they seem to have a good variety.<br>
Cindy: I don’t know. A friend of mine used them for her company and wasn’t&nbsp;impressed.<br>
Bob: Really? What exactly didn’t she like?<br>
Cindy: Well, the food… she said the food was good, but not quite the variety they’d&nbsp;expected. The drinks included some <span class="explainq5 explain">wine</span>, which was&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;not very good.<br>
Bob: Oh. Well, perhaps we need to consider this one… er … Company Caterers.<br>
Cindy: Looks a bit&nbsp;pricey. Mind you, I’ve heard that they are very good.<br>
Bob: Let me check the price. … Yes … £12 a head for food. That’s more than our budget. Do you think we could get a&nbsp;discount?<br>
Cindy: Let’s see if it says anything in the pamphlet. … Yes, they do offer a discount for groups of more than 30. … <span class="explainq6 explain">10%</span> … does that help us?&nbsp;<br>
Bob: 10% off £12 … It’s still more than we&nbsp;budgeted&nbsp;for.<br>
Cindy: Hey, look at this one. Celebrations.<br>
Bob: It’s a new company. I asked a few people about them, but no-one has any ideas.<br>
Cindy: Well, let’s see.&nbsp;9 poundsa head for food and&nbsp;five pounds&nbsp;a head for drinks. That’s fine. What kind of food do they have? It says here that they just provide&nbsp;<span class="explainq7 explain">cold meals</span>&nbsp;for picnics. Well, that’s OK. … And they include&nbsp;vegetarian&nbsp;dishes…. We do have some <span class="explainq8 explain">vegetarian</span> to take into&nbsp;consideration&nbsp;.<br>
Bob: Well, it looks good to me. The only problem is their lack of experience. I mean, it’s a bit of a risk, isn’t it?<br>
Cindy: Yes. If the food is no good, we’ll look&nbsp;incompetent.<br>
Bob: Ah, look here. It says that we can visit their&nbsp;premises&nbsp;and try some of the dishes they offer.<br>
Cindy: You mean we might get a free lunch? Shall we call them and arrange to go and see them?<br>
Bob: OK. Which day? How about tomorrow?<br>
Cindy: No. We’ve got that meeting. The day after tomorrow.&nbsp;<span class="explainq9 explain">Thursday</span>.&nbsp;<br>
Bob: Good. Time?<br>
Cindy: 11?<br>
Bob: Good. Right, what’s their phone number?&nbsp;<span class="explainq10 explain">28 65 34 79</span>. We also need to ask them whether they can deliver straight to the picnic site, don’t we?<br>
Cindy: Yes. I don’t think that’ll be a problem, though. I mean, it’s on the&nbsp;outskirts&nbsp;of the city, but it’s not too far away. Does the price include&nbsp;delivery?<br>
Bob: It doesn’t say, but the other companies include it, so they should. If they don’t., our budget still allows us to pay a small fee.&nbsp;</p>
