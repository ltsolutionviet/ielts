<p class="text-align-justify">Presenter: Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Sally Miller and I'm here to offer you some advice on legal matters whilst you are studying at this university. Happily, most international students complete their courses without running into any serious legal problems, but if you do find yourself involved in a legal dispute of any kind, ask for help. There are two options. First, contact the students' union or welfare officer. Even if they cannot help you directly, they should be able to advise you where to go for help. The second possibility is to contact the Citizens Advice Bureau in your area. You can find them in the local telephone directory. They will be able to <span class="explainq11 explain">recommend</span> a&nbsp;solicitor if you need one, and tell you if there is a local law centre providing free legal advice. They will also be able to tell you whether you can claim&nbsp;<span class="explainq12 explain">legal aid</span> to help pay for any court and legal fees. Let me give you some basic information about the police. The police have the power to stop and search anyone who appears to be behaving in a suspicious manner. If you are arrested for any reason, even if you know it to be a wrong reason, remember a few very important things. One, don't be aggressive. Two, do not try to bribe the police officer. Three, if you are arrested&nbsp;by plain-clothes police officers, ask to see some <span class="explainq13 explain">form of identification.</span> Four, give your true name and address if the officer asks you to. Lying to the police is a criminal offence. Five, do not sign any statement until you have&nbsp;received <span class="explainq14 explain">advice</span> from a solicitor. There is always a solicitor on duty at every police station. Six, you will be entitled to make one telephone call. If you use this call to telephone a friend, urge your friend to contact someone from your university or from the students' union and get advice about what you should do next. &nbsp; &nbsp;If you find yourself in trouble with the police, it is very important to get professional advice. Contact any of the following: your university welfare officer, the students' union at your university, your local Citizens Advice Bureau, a local law centre. If you are found guilty of an offence, it could seriously damage your position as an international student, so be sure to ask for help as early in the process as possible. &nbsp; &nbsp;Remember: obey the local laws! The laws here may not be quite the same as in your own country. Here are a few examples of actions that are illegal here. It is against the law to: possess <span class="explainq15 explain">offensive weapons</span>, e.g. knives, guns, chemical sprays used for personal defence—even women are not allowed to carry sprays or other deterrents to protect themselves against possible assault—except for rape alarms, possess or <span class="explainq16 explain">supply</span> hard or soft drugs, &nbsp;disturb the peace — this is called "disorderly conduct". This means that you can be arrested for being too noisy or rowdy. &nbsp; &nbsp;A few words about drinking. In this country, it is perfectly acceptable for adults to drink alcohol in moderate amounts. For many people, drinking is an established part of their social life—"going out for a drink" is how they relax or spend time with friends. If you go to a party or visit people at home in the evening, your host will probably offer you a drink. Often a lot of university social life can revolve around drinking, especially for undergraduates.<span class="explainq17 explain"> Do not be surprised if people arrange to meet in a bar</span> or if events are held in a pub. <span class="explainq18 explain">But you are not obliged to drink alcohol if you do not want to even&nbsp;if you are in a pub or at a party where everyone else is drinking. You can always ask for a non-alcoholic drink instead</span>. And if you feel uncomfortable going to places that serve alcohol, explain this to your friends—there are lots of other places where you can meet. If you do choose to drink, remember that you should never drive a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol—it is dangerous and the police can impose serious penalties on you. Also remember that being drunk in public is not acceptable either, and the police can arrest you for it. &nbsp; &nbsp;Drugs and alcohol can cause serious problems. Let me repeat that in this country, <span class="explainq19 explain">it is illegal to use drugs, except under medical supervision</span>. But, &nbsp;if you do use illegal drugs and you develop a problem, there are organisations you can contact. Contact your students' union or your student counsellor. <span class="explainq20 explain">Anyone over 18 years old can legally buy and consume alcoholic drinks</span>&nbsp;in this country, but if you think you might be drinking too much, get help and advice from your student counsellor or your doctor. Again, there are special organisations that can help you with drug and alcohol problems. Contact them.</p>
