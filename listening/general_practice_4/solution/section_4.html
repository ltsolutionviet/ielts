<p class="text-align-justify">You will hear a tutor giving some Business students instructions about a finance project.<br>
<br>
Tutor. OK, can you&nbsp;quiet&nbsp;down please? Now. today. I’m going to talk to you about your&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
We’ve been studying the effects of the&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;rate so I’m going to give you a project to do on this. Right, can you make some notes while I’m talking. The first thing that I’d like you to do in order to&nbsp;prepare&nbsp;this is to <span class="explainq31 explain">select </span>where you’re interested in. I mean, which country, and therefore which&nbsp;currency&nbsp;you’re going to be operating in. OK. Now the purpose of the project is to make money and I’m hoping some of you will make a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;amount! So I want you to suppose that you have&nbsp;100 pounds&nbsp;that you will have to <span class="explainq32 explain">invest</span>&nbsp;purely&nbsp;in the rises and falls of the exchange system. In other words, you’ll be trying to&nbsp;predict&nbsp;rates. This is a project that you’ll be doing together but, before you work together, you’ll have to go off and&nbsp;<span class="explainq33 explain">research </span>what you need to know about the&nbsp;economy&nbsp;of that country and how well it’s doing or is&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to do in the near future. You could all make up a little information sheet with your notes on. clearly&nbsp;legible&nbsp;, because then I want you to get together – we can do that next week – and to go round and read about each other’s&nbsp;countries&nbsp;. When you see how well or badly each country is doing, I want you to decide what your&nbsp;exchange rate&nbsp;is going to be against all the other&nbsp;currencies&nbsp;. After that is all sorted, what you’re going to do is to go round the other students and&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;to <span class="explainq34 explain">sell y</span>our money to the others – remember this will depend on the success of your country’s economy anti the rate you’ve fixed for your currency. Now, you’re not allowed to just&nbsp;swap&nbsp;currencies with each other but you may wish to <span class="explainq35 explain">buy </span>from the other countries – but you must do a proper&nbsp;transaction&nbsp;. All the way through this you must keep your accounts&nbsp;properly&nbsp;for each transaction. I’ll give you one week to do this and then we will set a time for the deals to finish – a bit like the&nbsp;stock exchange&nbsp;– and. at that point. I will ask you to&nbsp;<span class="explainq36 explain">calculate&nbsp;</span>how much you have made. Is that clear?<br>
<br>
Now before you begin that, there are a few things I&nbsp;want you to read up on to prepare. You need to look at the&nbsp;economies&nbsp;of the UK’s main trading partners. I don’t mean all of them because that would be over 80, but just the&nbsp;<span class="explainq37 explain">29 </span>principle&nbsp;ones. There are&nbsp;summaries&nbsp;in the last three books on the booklist I’ve given you. And so that you can practise applying the criteria on&nbsp;assessment&nbsp;I gave you. I’d then like you to focus just on one&nbsp;sector&nbsp;across all the countries. The most common one across every country is farming but. as much&nbsp;agricultural&nbsp;produce is for domestic&nbsp;consumption&nbsp;, I’d like you to look at <span class="explainq38 explain">manufacturing</span>. Then, I would like you to do a detailed&nbsp;investigation&nbsp;of one&nbsp;particular aspect&nbsp;. I was going to give you a choice but I think, as we’ve just started the course, it’s better if we all look at the same thing and then we can&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;it in the seminars. So the thing I’d like you all to look at is&nbsp;fluctuations&nbsp;in <span class="explainq39 explain">import prices</span>. Now you need to do all that before you start the project as it will help you&nbsp;assess&nbsp;the economies of the countries you’ll be&nbsp;representing&nbsp;in the project. Don’t worry you’ve got plenty of time. Exam week is December 8th, then it’s the holidays until January 6th so I don’t need the&nbsp;project&nbsp;in till <span class="explainq40 explain">February 5th</span>. Is that OK? Now, any questions ...</p>
