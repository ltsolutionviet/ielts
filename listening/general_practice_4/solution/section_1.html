<p>You will hear a woman asking a shop assistant about DVD players.<br>
<br>
Customer: Hello. I’m interested in buying a&nbsp;dvd player&nbsp;. Can you help me as I don’t know very much about them.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Of course. We sell quite a&nbsp;range&nbsp;. Actually, we’re doing a customer&nbsp;survey&nbsp;at the moment. So I wonder if 1 could fill in this form about you and that will actually help me to&nbsp;advise&nbsp;you on the best DVD player for you.<br>
<br>
Customer: OK …<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: First of all. your&nbsp;occupation&nbsp;?<br>
<br>
Customer: Um – <span class="explainqe explain">student</span>.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: OK. Then, have you already got a DVD player?<br>
<br>
Customer: No. I’ve never had one hefore.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: And how much do you think you want to spend on a player?<br>
<br>
Customer: I’m not sure really – but I have got a&nbsp;budget&nbsp;. My friend said I should allow about £a hundred pounds&nbsp;but I can’t afford over <span class="explainq1 explain">£85</span>, so that’s what I’m working on.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: And do you watch DVDs very often?<br>
<br>
Customer Um – depends what you mean by often. I don’t know w hat the norm is – is it about two a week?<br>
<br>
I suppose I watch&nbsp;<span class="explainq2 explain">three a month</span>&nbsp;. That’s enough for me!<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Yes (laughs). What sort of films do you like watching then? Action movies?<br>
<br>
Customer: (laughs) Not really. My&nbsp;boyfriend&nbsp;always insists we watch&nbsp;science fiction&nbsp;movies but I prefer&nbsp;<span class="explainq3 explain">thrillers </span>something&nbsp;. Somethin? to get your teeth into!<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: OK. Just one more. Do you watch other DVDs – ones that are not films – like music or something?<br>
<br>
Customer: Not much because I don’t want to spend the money on something I can watch on TV but I&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;rent out <span class="explainq4 explain">comedy programmes</span>. And I fight with my boyfriend over all the sports DVDs he watches.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: OK. Let me explain a bit to you about the DVD players that are in your&nbsp;price range&nbsp;. First there’s the DB 30 which has only got&nbsp;basic features&nbsp;but it is a&nbsp;bargain&nbsp;at £69. Now all the DVDs come with an after-sales service that starts when the&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;runs out. As it’s so cheap the&nbsp;db 30&nbsp;comes with a limited after-sales service as it unlv includes <span class="explainq5 explain">parts</span>. You would have to pay for most of the repair.<br>
<br>
Customer: Seems OK.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Then a slight grade up from that is the&nbsp;xl 643&nbsp;. This comes w ith an&nbsp;additionalfeature in that it has extra button allowing you to <span class="explainq6 explain">record</span>. That’s quite useful.<br>
<br>
Customer: Oh yes. That would mean&nbsp;spending&nbsp;less on DVDs to watch.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Yes, so you’d make the extra money back on it that it costs. Let me see how much it is … ah. yes. that one’s actually&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;at the moment from&nbsp;79 pounds to <span class="explainq7 explain">&nbsp;£71 99</span>&nbsp;. I think it’s worth the extra myself.<br>
<br>
Customer: And is that the same level of after-sales service as the other one?<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Well, you get a bit more for your money because what we are offering is a&nbsp;discount&nbsp;on <span class="explainq8 explain">labour</span>. So you don’t pay the full price if you have to call an&nbsp;engineer&nbsp;out.<br>
<br>
Customer: I see.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: Then the last one is this&nbsp;tri x 24&nbsp;. It’s a very good player and you can use it to listen to your <span class="explainq9 explain">CDs</span> as well as watch DVDs.<br>
<br>
Customer: It looks nice – but I bet it’s&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Shop assistant: No, it’s not top of the range. I jet’s see – yes it’s&nbsp;94 pounds&nbsp;– but. what von hnvc in remember is that, that includes&nbsp;<span class="explainq10 explain">insurance&nbsp;</span>, so you don’t have to pay extra for that. And it comes with a&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;that’s valid for three years as&nbsp;opposed&nbsp;to the usual one. What do you think?<br>
<br>
Customer: Hm, maybe … (fade) …</p>
