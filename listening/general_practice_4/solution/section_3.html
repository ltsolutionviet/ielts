<p>You will hear a student, Alex, asking his tutor Tor advice about essay writing.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Hi. Alex, comc in. I gather you wanted some help with writing essays.<br>
<br>
Alex: Yes. I’m finding this first term difficult and I’m worried about the&nbsp;assignments&nbsp;we have to do for January.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Well, let me see if I can help. You shouldn’t panic about it because essay writing is a very&nbsp;straightforward&nbsp;process really. What it involves is&nbsp;<span class="explainq21 explain">organising&nbsp;</span>the information that you want to include. You shouldn’t have more than you can easily&nbsp;manage&nbsp;within the word count. Make sure you haven’t got too much or anything&nbsp;irrelevant hmm&nbsp;. You need to look at that and work out what you need and what you don’t need before you start. And then you just have to think about how you’re going to pul forward your&nbsp;<span class="explainq22 explain">argument&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
Alex: Oh, that sounds very straight forward when you put it like that. But I’m&nbsp;worried&nbsp;I haven’t got the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;skills for writing an&nbsp;effective&nbsp;essay because English is my second language.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Well, perhaps you&nbsp;misunderstand&nbsp;the skills you need. You need to be able to&nbsp;analyzeyour data and then 1 would say the skills of&nbsp;<span class="explainq23 explain">interpretation&nbsp;</span>and expressing yourself are important. Perhaps it’s this last one that bothers you, but the more essays you write, the more you will develop these skills.<br>
<br>
Alex: Yes and I don’t quite know how to improve at that though as you say. I know practice will help. And I need to make sure I’ve got everything ready before I start.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Yes. What is vital to good essay writing is&nbsp;<span class="explainq24 explain">preparation&nbsp;</span>so make sure you build in enough time to do the research you need.<br>
<br>
Alex: Are there any other sources I can use to help me with essays?<br>
<br>
Tutor Yes. You should go to the library and look through the&nbsp;reference&nbsp;section because there are hooks that focus on the <span class="explainq25 explain">style </span>we use in&nbsp;academic&nbsp;writing and those will help you a lot, The other thing that you should think about is, what happens when you’ve&nbsp;actually&nbsp;written your essay. Too many students just&nbsp;complete&nbsp;their work and hand it in. Whereas what you should be doing is making sure that you <span class="explainq26 explain">edit </span>it as&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;as possible.<br>
<br>
Alex: Oh. yes. That’s a good idea. Then I’d pick up any mistakes and also see if it reads&nbsp;logically&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Exactly. The other thing is. again, what a lot of students do is get their essays back, look at the marks, then just file it away. They don’t seem to&nbsp;realize&nbsp;that if they checkcd it through and looked at what the tutor had written, then they can <span class="explainq27 explain">learn </span>from their old essays.<br>
<br>
Alex: Yeah. I can see that’s a good idea.<br>
<br>
Tutor So, is that OK? You can always come back to me.<br>
<br>
Alex: Actually, there were a couple of other things I wanted to ask you about essay writing. 1 had had a few thoughts of my own about what 1 should do such as really taking&nbsp;good noteswhen I’m reading because that helps, doesn’t it?<br>
<br>
Tutor I think if&nbsp;improves your&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;rather than your actual writing<span class="explainq28 explain">.</span><span class="explainq29 explain"> <span class="explainq30 explain">But one lip I can give you is to try and not read too much, otherwise you end up including&nbsp;irrelevant material&nbsp;in your essay</span>. </span>Remember to stay on task.<br>
<br>
Alex: Yes, sometimes I have problems&nbsp;interpreting&nbsp;the questions correctly, or the whole question seems overwhelming to me. What I try to do is highlight the key parts and divide it into&nbsp;smaller chunks&nbsp;, so I can manage it.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Well, you might find it useful to break it down even further by making sure you, understand all the words&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;before you start. Things like ‘assess’ or ‘comment’ and such like.<br>
<br>
Alex: Yes, I see.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Sometimes, after an objective&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;, the question actually asks you for a subjective opinion, but you must remember to support your&nbsp;arguments&nbsp;, if that’s the case. One final comment I can make is about using your own words – you must try to do this as far as possible.<span class="explainq28 explain"> <span class="explainq29 explain"><span class="explainq30 explain">You’re expected to&nbsp;summarize&nbsp;what you’ve read nol just siring together a list of&nbsp;quotations&nbsp;.</span> </span></span>In fact, you shouldn’t have too many – just use them where it’s really important.<br>
<br>
Alex: OK. thanks.<br>
<br>
Tutor: Do you read other student’s essays when you’ve finished?<br>
<br>
Alex: No. Why? Is that a good idea?<br>
<br>
Tutor: Well, you can confuse each other so I’d advise&nbsp;against&nbsp;it – but it’s up to you.<br>
<br>
Alex: OK. Thanks very much … (fade) …</p>
