<p>You will hear a salesman giving information to house owners about an alarm system.<br>
<br>
Salesman: Thank you for inviting me to your&nbsp;residence&nbsp;meeting. My name is Martin Pugh from Safe Sell Alarms. I’m going to explain a little bit about home&nbsp;security&nbsp;and I hope you’ll all feel a bit better&nbsp;informed&nbsp;and perhaps that you will even&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;one of the alarms we sell. It is all too easy these days for people to break in to our homes. Did you know that 25% of all&nbsp;burglaries&nbsp;are committed by burglars breaking and&nbsp;entering&nbsp;via the <span class="explainq11 explain">back door</span>? Even though it is locked, it is still&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;easy for someone to gain entry. And there are parts of our house that we think are not&nbsp;vulnerable&nbsp;because they look&nbsp;inaccessible, but they’re not. So, if you’re trying to protect your home, you should make the sure <span class="explainq12 explain">top floor</span> is&nbsp;covered&nbsp;by that protection, not just the&nbsp;ground floor&nbsp;. We believe that the only way to secure your&nbsp;property&nbsp;is by having an alarm fitted. Just having the alarm on the outside can pul&nbsp;burglars&nbsp;off and we also recommend that you warn them about the alarm. To do this, we suggest von stick a <span class="explainq13 explain">sign </span>in the front window of the house so it can be seen&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;. This alone should be enough to&nbsp;dissuade&nbsp;a burglar before they start.<br>
<br>
Now, our company has a range of alarms on offer and I’ve brought several along for you to see tonight. But let me just explain a few things about them. First of all, all of our alarms are highly&nbsp;visible&nbsp;. They’re&nbsp;colored&nbsp;red and. on the&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;, there is a <span class="explainq14 explain">blue light</span>. which you can see whether they are&nbsp;switched&nbsp;on or not. This acts as a&nbsp;deterrent&nbsp;to burglars who can see it is an active alarm system. Like most systems, our alarms are very&nbsp;sensitive&nbsp;so you do need to look after them. You may be&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;to hear that a cat can often slink around&nbsp;unnoticedunder the&nbsp;infrared&nbsp;beams but a <span class="explainq15 explain">spider </span>crawling across them will set them off. Also, our system is a little different from some. Most companies offer an option that connects their alarms to the&nbsp;police station&nbsp;. All our alarms have an automatic link to our <span class="explainq16 explain">company office</span>. This means we can deal with the situation&nbsp;promptly&nbsp;and can sort out any alarms that have gone off by mistake.<br>
<br>
OK, let me tell you about the&nbsp;installation&nbsp;of our alarms. Later on I’ll show you some house plans and&nbsp;diagrams&nbsp;of how the alarms operate but you don’t have to worry about them being&nbsp;intrusive&nbsp;, as we normally put them i<span class="explainq17 explain">n hallways</span> rather than&nbsp;individual&nbsp;rooms. The diagrams show you how the beams work to cover the whole house in this way. Oh, one small thing while I remember, is don’t leave your&nbsp;security code&nbsp;in your house&nbsp; a lot of people keep it in the kitchen or their study but we suggest you leave it <span class="explainq18 explain">with a&nbsp;neighbour</span>&nbsp;so that if there is a break in, the burglars can’t switch the system off. Now,&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;the practical&nbsp;aspects&nbsp;of installation. I know that many of you are out all day and I’m afraid we don’t install the alarms at weekends, but we do offer a service where we can fit the alarm system <span class="explainq19 explain">in the evenings</span> for you but we do&nbsp;charge&nbsp;a little bit extra for that. Finally, we do offer a range of&nbsp;systems&nbsp;, so I suggest you look at the&nbsp;leaflets&nbsp;on our prices. And please don’t be put off from investing in a more&nbsp;sophisticated&nbsp;system to protect your home as we do allow you to set up a <span class="explainq20 explain">monthly&nbsp;</span>payment&nbsp;if it’s too much in one go. OK. now. if you’d like to … (fade)…</p>
