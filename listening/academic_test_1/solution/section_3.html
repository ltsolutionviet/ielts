<div class="passage-content"> <h1><strong>SECTION&nbsp;3</strong></h1>

<p>Hello... are you Professor Van Diezen?<br>
Yes, I am. And who might you be?<br>
Oh! Sorry, my name is Tina. I’m a freshman here. They told me I should ask you for advice in choosing courses.<br>
Well, that’s part of what I’m here for. Please come in and sit down. Now, what are your questions?<br>
I, I almost don’t know! Everything is so confusing! Like what is a “specialised course”?<br>
Oh, easy.<span class="explainq21 explain"> A specialised course is one that is compulsory,&nbsp;meaning it's a requirement for your major and regular, so you can’t place out by taking a proficiency exam.</span></p>

<p>That sounds pretty strict. Then what are all these gen­eral courses? I seem to have to take so many.<br>
Nothing to be alarmed over. These are courses open to all students and not directly related to your major. The university offers these general courses to choose so that you can become more well-rounded individuals. For ex­ample, I see you’re a Microbiology major. So it might be a good idea to take some literature or history courses so that you can know something besides all science.<br>
You mean these courses are, like, for fun?<br>
That might be one way to look at it, but don’t tell the lit­erature professor such a thing. Think of a general course as the opposite of a specified course. A specified course is one that pertains directly to your major.<br>
So can I take any Microbiology course I want?<br>
Let’s see. Oh, those courses used to be open to Micro­biology students only. <span class="explainq22 explain">The good thing is, now it’s open&nbsp;to students on a flexible schedule, so it’s not only for full-time students.</span> So the answer is yes, if you have the instructor’s permission. May I ask you why you chose Microbiology?<br>
<br>
Well, I also like plain old Biology, too. You know, full­sized animals. I might even become a veterinarian. Could I take some Biology classes?<br>
Well,<span class="explainq23 explain"> they are open to full-time students only</span>, which I believe is what you are. I don’t know how a freshman would get along with Microbiology, though. I mean, <span class="explainq24 explain">most of the students presently looking into it are from off-campus</span>.<br>
Off-campus?<br>
Yes, you know, people who use it in their work at hos­pitals, laboratories, even a police detective. Why did you choose Microbiology, if I may ask? I don’t think you quite answered that.<br>
Well, eventually I want to be a doctor. At least my dad tells me so.<br>
If I may say so, young lady, you seem a little uncertain.</p>

<p>Still, I think that might be a good idea for a career. Of course, if you're thinking about being either a doctor or a vet, you should take some Medical Science classes before you even think of applying to med school.<br>
Great! What should I take?<br>
There is one small problem. <span class="explainq25 explain">The new Medical Sciences&nbsp;building is under construction, so there are no experi­mental facilities available until next yea</span>r. I’m afraid you'll have to wait. But don’t forget to take those courses at the first opportunity!<br>
Oh, bummer. Is there any other course you'd recommend for someone like me?<br>
Well, since you seem to like animals, <span class="explainq26 explain">have you ever thought about looking into Environmental Science?</span><br>
No, I never really thought about it before. Is it worthwhile?<br>
Quite! <span class="explainq26 explain">In fact, it's the fastest growing subject on this campus.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry, I couldn’t help noticing the long list of classes you’ve written out there. May I have a look?<br>
Oh, sure.<br>
Medical Science, Statistics, Laboratory Techniques, Medicine, Mathematics, Computing. My, my, a bit of everything here.<br>
Is it too much?<br>
For your first semester, yes. <span class="explainq27 explain">What I suggest is starting out by taking the compulsory courses</span>. Like we said be­fore, the Medical Science can wait. Consider taking that in your sophomore year. I think I’d put off Computing, too. <span class="explainq27 explain">I recommend to all freshmen that I talk to to get the compulsory Mathematics out of the way as early as pos­sible</span>, so take that one. It’ll be one less difficult course you have to focus on when the science lab opens next year, and you have to catch up on classes like Laboratory Techniques. <span class="explainq28 explain">Your major also requires Statistics so you have to balance two Maths classes, and no doubt you should take that</span>.<span class="explainq29 explain"> Otherwise, get your required Medicine course out of the way by taking something theory-based.</span></p>

<p>Oh, of course and your Environmental Science class if you’re interested. The others can wait, though I think Computing is definitely a good idea, even though it’s not required. I see too, on your paper there, you seem to have had high marks on the entrance exam.<br>
Uhhh, yeah. I guess so.<br>
Don’t be shy! Have you thought about applying for a scholarship?<br>
Do they have any? I mean, my dad is always complain­ing about how much money it costs him.<br>
In your department, there are actually three full scholar­ships available. They cover tuition and provide $1,500 cash.<br>
$1,500 cash?! Party!<br>
Please, Miss. The money is intended more as a <span class="explainq30 explain">textbook allowance</span>, not party money. If you promise to behave,</p>

<p>I’ll show you how to apply.</p>

<p>Great, and thanks!</p>
