<div id="set-container-1" class="tab-section-reading active"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 1</h1><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon, you’re through to reception at The Island Hotel in Crete, how may I help you today?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Yes, hello there, I’m hoping to book a <span class="explainqe explain">double</span> room for my wife and myself for about two weeks from the 25th April of this year.&nbsp;Firstly, could you tell me whether it’s particularly hot during this&nbsp;time?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, of course Sir, during late April and early May, the daytime temperature shouldn’t exceed <span class="explainq1 explain">19</span> degrees Celsius, but the weather has been rather erratic and difficult to predict in recent years, so I&nbsp;am unable to say for certain.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Okay, that sounds good, my wife doesn’t like going outside when it’s very hot! I haven’t booked flights yet, but I must say that I’m&nbsp;unfamiliar with Crete and its transport system. Does the hotel&nbsp;provide an airport shuttle service?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes Sir, we provide a complementary airport pick-up service for all our guests. It takes about <span class="explainq2 explain">40 minutes</span> to get here from the airport, but it’s at least 60 minutes at rush hours and you will be&nbsp;provided with a fully air-conditioned shuttle bus.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Okay, excellent. In that case, do you have any rooms available for the dates I gave you?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall have a look on the system now for you Sir, bear with me&nbsp;just a moment, [brief pause] Yes Sir, I can see now that we have several rooms available. Would you prefer a garden view or a sea&nbsp;view?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Well, ideally I would like a sea-view room with a balcony, but of course that depends on the difference in price.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to worry Sir, all of our standard double rooms have en-suite facilities and a <span class="explainq3 explain">balcony</span>. If you would like one of our sea-view rooms, there is a premium of €60 per night.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Okay, so could you tell me the total nightly rate for a standard double room with a sea view?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, of course Sir, for the spring months, our rate is €216 per&nbsp;night. For 14 nights, altogether this will come to €3,024.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Perfect. I also read on your website that the hotel has gym and spa facilities. Are there any other facilities on offer?</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have a large outdoor infinity pool overlooking the ocean,&nbsp;with luxury sun beds and a poolside bar. We also have 3 full-sized <span class="explainq4 explain">tennis courts</span>, where we run a popular doubles tournament, with&nbsp;the winner receiving 2 all-inclusive spa day vouchers.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Goodness, I shall have to brush up on my tennis skills!</p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Are there any other activities organised by the hotel that we can partake in? It’s just that it’s our wedding anniversary on the 30th&nbsp;of June, and I would like to provide my wife with the perfect&nbsp;romantic getaway.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Reception: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you, Sir, that your wife won’t be disappointed. Ours&nbsp;is a 5-star resort which is renowned for its luxury and beauty. In terms of activities, the hotel provides thrice weekly entertainment.&nbsp;On Tuesdays, guests will take a mini bus and partake in learning&nbsp;to cook succulent <span class="explainq5 explain">fish dishes</span> with our Michelin starred chef,&nbsp;Enrique. The class will take place in a beautiful valley deep&nbsp;in the Cretan hills, where guests will be treated to an intimate&nbsp;<span class="explainq6 explain">piano</span> performance by our in-house concert pianist, Pedro. On&nbsp;Wednesdays, a select number of guests will be fortunate enough to&nbsp;explore the mountains by <span class="explainq7 explain">helicopter</span>, before being transported to a&nbsp;tropical <span class="explainq8 explain">Cretan garden</span> by shuttle bus. Finally, on Thursdays after&nbsp;a fancy dinner, we provide a spectacular <span class="explainq9 explain">fireworks</span> display, which&nbsp;guests can view from the comfort of a<span class="explainq10 explain"> cable car.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">Mr. Schiffer: Oh wow, that all sounds absolutely wonderful! I shall book the room now, and then I need to look at flights so as not to become&nbsp;extortionate. Would you like to take my details now or later? [fade&nbsp;out]</p></div></div>
