<div id="set-container-2" class="tab-section-reading hidden"><h2 class="subtitle"></h2><div class="passage-content"><h1 class="text-align-justify">SECTION 2</h1><p class="text-align-justify">BarterOnlineUK is a young, up and coming website in the United Kingdom where users can ‘buy’ new and used goods; however, instead of paying with&nbsp;money, registered users instead exchange their purchase for an item of similar&nbsp;value. This part is perhaps the most complicated, as the registered users&nbsp;themselves must mutually decide on an appropriate value, with value either&nbsp;being the recommended retail price (RRP), or simply how much they believe&nbsp;the item to be worth. The website has been founded by a group of four <span class="explainq11 explain">friends</span> in&nbsp;the north of England. Originally they exchanged their belongings among family&nbsp;members. They frequently found themselves swapping their belongings when&nbsp;they no longer had any use for them. They live by the motto ‘one person’s trash&nbsp;is another person’s treasure’, and hate to throw things away. As more and more&nbsp;people caught wind of the idea and wanted to participate in the exchanges, the&nbsp;group decided that the idea had the potential to become a successful business&nbsp;venture, and so it did.</p><p class="text-align-justify">BarterOnlineUK is a start-up online business, which took 3 months to set up and has now been running for <span class="explainq12 explain">around half a year.</span> Despite only being founded a&nbsp;short time ago, the website has already garnered about <span class="explainq13 explain">1,500</span> registered users,&nbsp;with 500 more than expected, a huge achievement for the founders. Some of the&nbsp;users are registered in the United Kingdom and Canada, with the majority&nbsp;from <span class="explainq14 explain">the Republic of Ireland</span>. In order to become a registered member, users&nbsp;must first fill in their personal details followed by their credit or debit card&nbsp;details, which will be used to take payment of a monthly fee of £5. As long&nbsp;as this fee is paid, users will be able to perform an unlimited number of&nbsp;online exchanges.</p><p class="text-align-justify">A multitude of items are sold on the website, such as textbooks, soft toys, and tools, however<span class="explainq15 explain"> books for children </span>and <span class="explainq16 explain">computer games </span>are by far selected most.&nbsp;The exchange process itself is not as complicated as it might seem, users can&nbsp;enter their preferences for what they would like to receive, and also explicitly&nbsp;state what they would like to give away, and the website will automatically pair&nbsp;up suitable users. If, however, a user doesn’t want to give anything away, but&nbsp;would simply like to buy something, BarterOnlineUK does support a secure&nbsp;online payment system where users can perform a normal monetary transaction.&nbsp;Despite this, the founding group strongly discourages the use of the online&nbsp;payment system, clearly stating that this goes against the intended ethos of the&nbsp;company.</p><p class="text-align-justify">Although bartering is an age-old process, many of the website’s users are unsure how to decide which of their own items to exchange. It often helps&nbsp;to order items by popularity using the ‘filter’ button provided, this will tell&nbsp;the website to find out <span class="explainq17 explain">popular</span> items for users’ convenience. To this, the&nbsp;founding members say just put everything you don’t want on there, different&nbsp;people have different <span class="explainq18 explain">tastes</span>, and you never know what they might be looking&nbsp;for! In order to aid registered users in their exchanges, and to provide them&nbsp;with assurance, the founders recently added a new feature whereby on&nbsp;completion of an exchange, users will be encouraged to provide each other&nbsp;with <span class="explainq19 explain">feedback</span>. This feedback will include criteria such as the quality of the&nbsp;item as compared with how it was advertised, the ease of communication&nbsp;with the seller, the <span class="explainq20 explain">speed</span> at which the item was delivered, and so on. The&nbsp;friends believe that using this method, users will have a more transparent and trustworthy bartering experience, [fade out]</p></div></div>
