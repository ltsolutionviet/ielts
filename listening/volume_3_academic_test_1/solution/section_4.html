Today we will examine recent and historical breakthroughs on the behaviour of chimpanzees, otherwise&nbsp;known as chimps.</p><p class="text-align-justify">The word ‘chimpanzee’ is an umbrella term for two different species of apes in the genus Pan, which are the Common Chimpanzee, or Pan Troglodytes, found in West&nbsp;and Central Africa, and the Bonobo, or Pan Paniscus, which are found in the forests&nbsp;of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Chimpanzees belong to the Hominidae&nbsp;family, together with gorillas, orangutans and indeed humans. Current research&nbsp;tells us that the chimps broke away from the human branch of the Hominidae&nbsp;family approximately six million years ago, and remain the closest living relative&nbsp;to humans to this day. More modern researches into chimpanzees have centred&nbsp;on their behavioural characteristics, once all biological and <span class="explainq31 explain">genetic</span> factors have&nbsp;been ruled out. In this way, scientists have unearthed an unfathomable amount of&nbsp;similarities between human and chimpanzee behaviour. Although much of this&nbsp;research has taken place through observation of captive chimps, the results are&nbsp;widely seen as an authoritative reflection of chimps living in the wild. Chimps live&nbsp;in large so-called communities comprised of many male and female members, with&nbsp;the social hierarchy determined by an individual chimp’s position and influence.&nbsp;Through such research, scientists have found that chimps learn and adapt through&nbsp;<span class="explainq32 explain">observation&nbsp;</span>of others’ behaviour. Once in power, the alpha male is often seen to alter its body language in order to retain power, for example he might puff himself up in&nbsp;order to intimidate others, while lower-ranking chimps are noted to behave more&nbsp;submissively and holding out their hands while granting. Female chimpanzees also&nbsp;have a distinct social hierarchy, with high social standing inherited by children. It is&nbsp;not unheard of for dominant females within a community to unite and overthrow the&nbsp;alpha male, backing another in his place.</p><p class="text-align-justify">James Diamond, in his book The Third Chimpanzee suggests that chimps should now be reclassified in the genus Homo, instead of Pan, and there&nbsp;are many arguments still in favour of this. Male common chimpanzees are on&nbsp;average 1.7 metres in height, weighing 70kg, with their female counterparts&nbsp;being somewhat smaller. By comparison, the Bonobo is slightly shorter and&nbsp;lighter, but with longer arms and legs; however, both species walk on all fours,&nbsp;and climb trees with great ease. Jane Goodall made a groundbreaking discovery&nbsp;in 1960, when she observed the use of <span class="explainq33 explain">tools</span> among chimpanzees, including&nbsp;digging for termites with large sticks. A recent study claimed to reveal that&nbsp;common chimpanzees in Senegal have been using spears sharpened with their&nbsp;teeth to hunt; however these reports remain unsubstantiated. Researchers have&nbsp;witnessed such tools, namely rocks, being used by chimps to<span class="explainq34 explain"> open</span>coconut&nbsp;shells and indeed crushing nuts with<span class="explainq35 explain"> stone</span>hammers. As scientific technology&nbsp;has developed, so too has our knowledge of the sheer extent of the chimp’s&nbsp;intelligence. Research has now shown that chimps have the capability to learn&nbsp;and use <span class="explainq36 explain">symbols</span>, and understand aspects of the human language, including&nbsp;syntax as well as numerical sequences.</p><p class="text-align-justify">As I mentioned earlier, the umbrella term ‘chimpanzee’ is comprised of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. These two sub-species are divided along&nbsp;the Congo River, with the common chimps living on one side, and the bonobos&nbsp;living on the opposite side of the <span class="explainq37 explain">river</span>. Over the past few decades, both of these&nbsp;sub-species have witnessed an alarming decrease in population <span class="explainq38 explain">density</span>, with&nbsp;animal activists now working harder than ever to protect those remaining and&nbsp;encourage procreation.</p><p class="text-align-justify">In addition, next week’s episode will focus more closely on how chimpanzees in captivity are able <span class="explainq39 explain">to learn things through imitating the behaviour of humans</span>, as&nbsp;well as how chimpanzees’ <span class="explainq40 explain">behaviours have developed over many generations.</span></p><p class="text-align-justify">Thank you very much for attending this evening’s lecture. I hope you found it intellectually stimulating, and I look forward to seeing you again next week.&nbsp;Goodnight!</p></div></div>
