<div class="passage-content"> <h1 class="text-align-justify"><strong>SECTION 1</strong></h1>

<p class="text-align-justify">Hello, and welcome to “Under Pressure Enterprises”, Customer Service Department. This is Kelly. How may I help you?<br>
HEWITT: Yes, I’m calling about one of your <span class="explainqe explain">rice cookers</span> I just purchased.<br>
CR: What seems to be the problem, sir?<br>
H: Seems? There’s no seeming about it! The blasted thing shoots hot steam all over the place, that’s what! It nearly scalded my hand when I went to open it. Why it could have killed the cat or something. It could have exploded and killed my wife and me!<br>
CR: Sir, sir, please calm down. As long as the steam escapes the cooker, it won’t explode.<br>
H: So you’re telling me there’s no problem! Are you calling me a liar?<br>
CR: Sir, no one is calling you a liar.<br>
H: Yes! So I demand a full refund!<br>
CR: Under Pressure will be happy to refund your money, sir. Now I just need some basic information.<br>
H: OK, OK. Sorry. I do tend to get a little hot under the collar. My wife tells me to slow down... So, what do you need to know?<br>
CR: Sir, don’t worry. I just need to ask you the model number of the cooker.<br>
H: Hmmm... where are my glasses? Ah, here! Let’s see... ah. It's<span class="explainq1 explain">R242</span>.<br>
CR: R242. OK, and how much did you pay for the product?<br>
H: <span class="explainq2 explain">89.99</span> pounds. It was on sale, I guess I should tell you.<br>
CR. Thank you, that’s honest of you. Now, where did you buy the cooker? Which store and which branch?<br>
H: At that big Electric Life appliance store downtown.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">CR: The <span class="explainq3 explain">City Centre</span> Branch?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">H: That’s the one.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">CR: And you say the problem is that the steam escapes?</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">H: Yes, it does!</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">CR: No problem, sir. If there’s steam escaping, clearly the cooker is broken or defective. So we have an R242 cooker with an <span class="explainq4 explain">escaping&nbsp;steam</span> problem. It was bought from Electric Life’s City Centre Branch for 89.99. Is that correct?<br>
H: Yes, that is correct.<br>
CR: Oh, I nearly forget. When did you buy the cooker?<br>
H: Just as soon as my wife got the crazy idea she’ll live longer if she stops eating good English food: roast beef and mash. No, all she says she wants is rice and vegetables and sauces you’d not soak your feet in!</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">CR: Sir, sir! When did you buy it?<br>
H: Oh, there I go again. Let’s see... we bought it just six months ago! We hardly used it either. But six months? Is that too long? I mean for the warranty?<br>
CR: Very well, that’s well within the warranty period. Now, what’s your name and address?<br>
H: Name and address! What for?<br>
CR: Sir, it is company policy. If you want your money, you must in­ form me.<br>
Money you say? Oh, my name is Herbert Hewitt and my address is <span class="explainq5 explain">84 Park Road</span>.<br>
CR: Is that here in Coventry?<br>
H Yes. The postal code is <span class="explainq6 explain">B0241DJ.</span> But I don’t think sending things in the mail is very secure or very efficient. I mean...<br>
CR: Don’t worry, Mr. Hewitt, don’t worry. We can credit the money to your <span class="explainq7 explain">credit card</span>. You do have one, don’t you?<br>
H: Yes, that's how we paid for the cooker.<br>
CR: Oh, yes. We still have the number on computer. I only need to ask your card's expiry date.<br>
H: I’m afraid I never give that sort of information out. I mean, once you have that, anyone could go charging things and...<br>
CR: Sir! I said your expiry date, not your card’s password.<br>
H: Oh, er, yes. Foolish me. Of course, you didn’t say “password”. Let's see. That will be <span class="explainq8 explain">April 2008</span>.&nbsp;<br>
CR: April 2008. Very well, your card still has nearly two months left to go. We'll get that <span class="explainq9 explain">refund</span> right to you, probably by five o’clock&nbsp;this evening.<br>
H: You had better! If I don’t get my money... wait, wait. Yes, I know I’m losing my temper again. I really am sorry. I haven’t had my medicine today.<br>
CR: And sir, just one more question for our record. How often do you go shopping at the City Centre Branch?<br>
H: Oh, well it’s hard to say. I suppose maybe <span class="explainq10 explain">once a month</span>. But I&nbsp;can tell you this, if I don’t get my refund, I’ll never shop there again! (He hangs up the phone.)<br>
CR: (sigh) I think it’s time to start looking for another job!&nbsp;</p>
